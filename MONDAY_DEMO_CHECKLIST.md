## üö® Emergency Fallback Plans

### If Registration Breaks During Demo
1. **Stay calm:** "Let me show you our audit trail instead"
2. **Open Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí `audit_logs` table
3. **Show comprehensive logging:**
   ```sql
   SELECT event_type, success, metadata, created_at
   FROM audit_logs
   WHERE event_category = 'AUTHENTICATION'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   ```
4. **Key Message:** "This is what HIPAA compliance looks like - complete audit trail, immutable, 7-year retention. More important than a pretty UI."

### If SMART Scribe Microphone Fails
1. **Pivot to pre-recorded demo** (if you create one)
2. **OR show the code suggestion logic:**
   - Open file: [src/components/smart/RealTimeSmartScribe.tsx](src/components/smart/RealTimeSmartScribe.tsx)
   - Show Claude Sonnet 4.5 integration

3. **Key Message:** "We use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for maximum billing accuracy - it's the most advanced medical coding AI available"

### If Internet Connection Drops
1. **Show offline capabilities** (if applicable)
2. **Show local database** (Supabase runs in cloud, so this is a real risk)
3. **Pivot to architecture discussion:**
   - Show [ST_FRANCIS_DEMO_READINESS.md](ST_FRANCIS_DEMO_READINESS.md)
   - Explain Epic integration architecture
   - Show database schema (129 patient fields)
