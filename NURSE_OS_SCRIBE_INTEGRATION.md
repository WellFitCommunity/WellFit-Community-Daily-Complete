- Save sessions to database with proper patient linkage

---

## What Was Missing

### ‚ùå Before (Not Connected)

**File:** `src/components/nurse/NursePanel.tsx` (Line 378)
```typescript
{/* Smart Medical Scribe */}
<CollapsibleSection title="Smart Medical Scribe" icon="üé§">
  <SmartScribe />  // ‚ùå No patient context
</CollapsibleSection>
```

**Problems:**
- No patient selection mechanism
- SmartScribe had no patient_id to save
- Sessions would fail to save (validation error)
- No way to link notes to patient charts
- Broken workflow for nurses

---

## What's Now Connected

### ‚úÖ After (Fully Connected)

**File:** `src/components/nurse/NursePanel.tsx`

**1. Patient Selection State (Lines 216-262)**
```typescript
const [selectedPatient, setSelectedPatient] = useState<{
  user_id: string;
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
} | null>(null);
const [myPatients, setMyPatients] = useState<any[]>([]);

// Load nurse's assigned patients from care_team table
React.useEffect(() => {
  const loadMyPatients = async () => {
    const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

    // Query care_team for nurse assignments
    const { data: assignments } = await supabase
      .from('care_team')
      .select(`
        patient_id,
        profiles!care_team_patient_id_fkey (
          user_id,
          first_name,
          last_name,
          date_of_birth,
          room_number
        )
      `)
      .eq('nurse_id', user.id);

    setMyPatients(assignments.map(a => a.profiles));
  };

  loadMyPatients();
}, []);
```

**2. Patient Selection UI (Lines 272-331)**
```typescript
<div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6">
  <h3>üë§ Select Patient for Documentation</h3>

  {/* Grid of assigned patients */}
  {myPatients.map(patient => (
    <button
      onClick={() => setSelectedPatient(patient)}
      className={selectedPatient?.user_id === patient.user_id
        ? 'border-blue-500 bg-blue-50'  // Selected
        : 'border-gray-200'             // Not selected
      }
    >
      {patient.first_name} {patient.last_name}
      {patient.room_number && <div>Room: {patient.room_number}</div>}
    </button>
  ))}

  {/* Current selection indicator */}
  {selectedPatient && (
    <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200">
      Currently Selected: {selectedPatient.first_name} {selectedPatient.last_name}
      <button onClick={() => setSelectedPatient(null)}>Clear</button>
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

**3. SmartScribe with Patient Context (Lines 485-517)**
```typescript
<CollapsibleSection title="Smart Medical Scribe - Nursing Documentation" icon="üé§">
  <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 p-4 mb-4">
    <strong>Nursing Documentation AI:</strong> Record nursing assessments,
    patient observations, care interventions, and shift notes.
  </div>

  {selectedPatient ? (
    <SmartScribe
      selectedPatientId={selectedPatient.user_id}
      selectedPatientName={`${selectedPatient.first_name} ${selectedPatient.last_name}`}
      onSessionComplete={(sessionId) => {
        console.log('‚úì Nurse scribe session completed:', sessionId);
        auditLogger.clinical('NURSE_SCRIBE_SESSION_COMPLETED', true, {
          sessionId,
          patientId: selectedPatient.user_id
        });
      }}
    />
  ) : (
    <div className="text-center py-12 bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-200">
      <h3>Patient Selection Required</h3>
      <p>Please select a patient from the list above before starting documentation.</p>
    </div>
  )}
</CollapsibleSection>
```

## Nursing-Specific Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Shift Assessment Documentation

**Scenario:** Night shift nurse doing rounds at 2am

**Nurse Says:**
```
"2am rounds, Mr. Thompson in Room 405. Patient sleeping comfortably.
Vital signs: BP 135/88, HR 68, RR 16, O2 sat 95% on 2L NC.
IV site clean and dry, no redness or swelling.
Foley catheter draining clear yellow urine, 200ml since midnight.
Patient repositioned to left side for pressure relief.
Call light within reach."
```

**AI Captures:**
- Vital signs documentation
- IV assessment
- Catheter care
- Repositioning for pressure ulcer prevention (billable activity)
- Safety check

**Saved to Database:**
```sql
INSERT INTO scribe_sessions (
  patient_id,
  provider_id,  -- Nurse's user_id
  transcription_text,
  clinical_time_minutes,
  ...
);
```

---

### Use Case 2: Wound Care Documentation

**Scenario:** Home health nurse doing wound care visit

**Nurse Says:**
```
"Home visit for Mrs. Garcia, diabetic foot ulcer care.
Wound on left heel, 2cm x 1.5cm, depth 0.5cm.
Granulation tissue present, minimal drainage, no odor.
Wound cleaned with normal saline, Santyl ointment applied,
non-adherent dressing and gauze wrap.
Patient education on keeping foot elevated, signs of infection to watch for.
Next dressing change in 3 days."
```

**AI Captures:**
- Wound measurement (required for Medicare billing)
- Wound characteristics (granulation, drainage)
- Treatment performed (wound care - highly billable)
- Patient education (billable)
- Plan documentation

**Billing Codes AI Might Suggest:**
- 97597/97598 - Wound debridement
- 99509 - Home visit, moderate complexity
- Teaching/education time

---

### Use Case 3: Medication Administration

**Scenario:** Med/surg nurse administering IV antibiotics

**Nurse Says:**
```
"8am medication pass for Mr. Lee, Room 210.
Vancomycin 1 gram IV piggyback administered over 60 minutes via peripheral IV left forearm.
Patient tolerated without adverse reaction.
Vital signs before: BP 118/72, HR 78.
Vital signs after: BP 122/76, HR 80, no complaints.
IV site assessed: no redness, swelling, or pain."
```

**AI Captures:**
- Medication name, dose, route
- Administration time and duration
- Patient tolerance
- Vital signs monitoring
- IV site assessment

---

## Database Schema Integration

### How Nurse Sessions Save

**Table:** `scribe_sessions`

```sql
-- When nurse stops recording:
INSERT INTO scribe_sessions (
  id,                          -- UUID auto-generated
  patient_id,                  -- From selectedPatient.user_id
  provider_id,                 -- Nurse's user_id
  created_by,                  -- Nurse's user_id
  recording_started_at,        -- Timestamp when recording started
  recording_ended_at,          -- Timestamp when recording stopped
  recording_duration_seconds,  -- Total recording time
  transcription_text,          -- Full transcript of nursing note
  transcription_status,        -- 'completed'
  ai_note_subjective,          -- Patient's report
  ai_note_objective,           -- Nurse's observations
  ai_note_assessment,          -- Clinical assessment
  ai_note_plan,                -- Care plan
  suggested_cpt_codes,         -- Billable nursing activities (JSONB)
  suggested_icd10_codes,       -- Related diagnoses (JSONB)
  clinical_time_minutes,       -- Duration in minutes
  is_ccm_eligible,             -- If >= 20 minutes
  model_version,               -- 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929'
  created_at,                  -- Timestamp
  updated_at                   -- Timestamp
) VALUES (...);
```

## Nurse vs Physician: Differences

### Similarities ‚úÖ
- Both use same SmartScribe component
- Both require patient selection
- Both save to `scribe_sessions` table
- Both use Claude Sonnet 4.5 for AI analysis
- Both have timer for CCM eligibility
- Both removed revenue counter (professional optics)

### Differences üîÑ

| Feature | Physician | Nurse |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Patient Source** | All patients in system | Assigned via `care_team` table |
| **Use Case** | Diagnosis, treatment plans | Assessments, interventions, care notes |
| **Billing Focus** | E/M codes, procedures | Nursing activities, wound care, education |
| **Documentation Type** | SOAP notes, H&P | Nursing notes, flow sheets |
| **Typical Duration** | 10-30 minutes | 5-15 minutes per patient |
| **Location** | Physician Panel | Nurse OS (Lighthouse) |

## Billing Integration for Nurses

### Nurse-Specific Billable Activities

AI can identify and code:

**Wound Care:**
- 97597 - Debridement, <20 sq cm
- 97598 - Debridement, each additional 20 sq cm
- 97602 - Wound care (non-selective debridement)

**Patient Education:**
- 98960 - Self-management education (individual)
- 98961 - Self-management education (2-4 patients)
- 98962 - Self-management education (5-8 patients)

**Care Coordination:**
- 99490 - CCM, first 20 minutes
- 99439 - CCM, each additional 20 minutes
- 99487 - Complex CCM, first 60 minutes

**Home Health:**
- 99509 - Home visit for assistance with ADLs
- 99510 - Home visit for individual/family counseling

**Transitional Care:**
- 99495 - Moderate complexity (14 days post-discharge)
- 99496 - High complexity (14 days post-discharge)

---

## Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Audit Logging

**Every nurse scribe session logs:**
```typescript
auditLogger.clinical('NURSE_SCRIBE_SESSION_COMPLETED', true, {
  sessionId: 'uuid',
  patientId: 'patient-uuid',
  nurseId: 'nurse-uuid',
  durationSeconds: 780,
  codesGenerated: 3,
  timestamp: '2025-10-26T...'
});
```

**Stored in:** `audit_logs` table (7-year retention, immutable)

### Access Control

**RLS Policies Needed (TO DO):**
```sql
-- Nurses can read own scribe sessions
CREATE POLICY nurse_scribe_sessions_own ON scribe_sessions
  FOR SELECT
  USING (provider_id = auth.uid());

-- Nurses can read sessions for assigned patients
CREATE POLICY nurse_scribe_sessions_assigned ON scribe_sessions
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    patient_id IN (
      SELECT patient_id FROM care_team WHERE nurse_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

---

## Testing the Integration

### Manual Test Workflow

1. **Create Test Nurse User:**
   ```sql
   -- Insert nurse into profiles table
   INSERT INTO profiles (user_id, first_name, last_name, role, role_code)
   VALUES ('nurse-uuid', 'Jane', 'Nurse', 'nurse', 3);
   ```

2. **Assign Test Patient:**
   ```sql
   -- Create care team assignment
   INSERT INTO care_team (patient_id, nurse_id)
   VALUES ('patient-uuid', 'nurse-uuid');
   ```

3. **Login as Nurse:**
   - Navigate to `/nurse`
   - Should see Lighthouse Dashboard

4. **Verify Patient Selection:**
   - Patient selection box shows at top
   - Test patient appears in list
   - Click to select

5. **Open SmartScribe:**
   - Expand "Smart Medical Scribe - Nursing Documentation"
   - Should see SmartScribe with patient name in header

6. **Record Test Session:**
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Speak: "Test nursing assessment for [patient name]..."
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Click "Stop Recording"

7. **Verify Database Save:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, patient_id, provider_id, recording_duration_seconds,
          transcription_text
   FROM scribe_sessions
   WHERE provider_id = 'nurse-uuid'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
   - Should return 1 row
   - `patient_id` should match selected patient
   - `provider_id` should be nurse's user_id
   - Transcript should contain test text

8. **Check Audit Logs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT event_type, success, metadata
   FROM audit_logs
   WHERE event_type = 'NURSE_SCRIBE_SESSION_COMPLETED'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
   - Should see logged session
