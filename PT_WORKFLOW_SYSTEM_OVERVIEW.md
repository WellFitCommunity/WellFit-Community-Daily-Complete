## Clinical Workflow: Initial Evaluation to Discharge

### Phase 1: Initial Evaluation (pt_functional_assessments)

**ICF Framework Implementation:**
```
Body Structure/Function Assessment:
├── Pain Assessment (Location, Quality, NRS 0-10, Aggravating/Alleviating Factors)
├── Range of Motion (Goniometric measurements by joint)
├── Muscle Strength Testing (MMT 0-5 scale)
├── Sensory Assessment (Light touch, proprioception, vibration)
├── Reflex Testing (Deep tendon reflexes)
├── Special Tests (Orthopedic special tests: Lachman, Neer's, etc.)
├── Posture Analysis
├── Gait Analysis (Pattern, device, deviations, weight-bearing status)
└── Balance Assessment (Static/dynamic, single-leg stance, Berg, ABC scale)

Activity Limitations (FIM Scale 1-7):
├── Bed Mobility
├── Transfers
├── Ambulation
└── Stair Negotiation

Participation Restrictions:
├── Work demands and return-to-work goals
├── Hobbies and recreational activities
├── Social roles and community participation
└── Patient-stated functional goals
```

**Social Determinants of Health Integration:**
- Living Situation (Independent, Assisted Living, SNF)
- Home Accessibility (Stairs, railings, bathroom modifications)
- Transportation Access (Independent driving, family, public transit)
- Support System (Family involvement, caregiver availability)
- Occupation and Work Demands (Physical demand level, ergonomic concerns)

**Standardized Outcome Measures:**
The system supports ALL major validated PT outcome measures:
- **Lower Extremity**: LEFS (MCID: 9 points), TUG, 6-Minute Walk Test
- **Spine**: Oswestry Disability Index (MCID: 10%), Neck Disability Index
- **Upper Extremity**: DASH/QuickDASH (MCID: 10 points)

  "goal_id": "goal_001",
  "goal_statement": "Patient will ambulate 150 feet with rolling walker, supervision level, within 3 weeks to enable safe discharge home.",
  "icf_category": "activity",
  "baseline_status": "Ambulates 50 feet with rolling walker, moderate assistance",
