## 🧪 How to Test Your PWA (5 Minutes)

### Test 1: Verify Service Worker is Running

**1. Build your app:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**2. Serve it locally with HTTPS:**
```bash
# Install serve globally (one-time)
npm install -g serve

# Serve with HTTPS (required for service workers)
npx serve -s build --listen 8443
```

**3. Open in browser:**
- Go to: `https://localhost:8443`
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to **Application** tab
- Click **Service Workers** in left sidebar

**Expected result:**
```
✅ service-worker.js
   Status: activated and is running

## 🎯 PWA Features for Rural America

### Why This Matters (Investor Pitch):

**Problem:** Rural clinics have unreliable internet
- Satellite internet (300ms+ latency, frequent dropouts)
- DSL (slow, unstable)
- Power outages
- No IT staff to troubleshoot

**Your Solution (PWA):**
- ✅ **Offline-first architecture** - Works without internet
- ✅ **Automatic caching** - Pages load instantly from cache
- ✅ **Background sync** - Queues data, syncs when online
- ✅ **No installation needed** - Runs in browser
- ✅ **Auto-updates** - No manual app store updates
- ✅ **Cross-platform** - Same code works on iOS, Android, desktop

**Real-world impact:**
- Nurse in Montana loses internet during patient visit
- PWA keeps working from cache
- Nurse completes charting, saves locally
- Internet returns 2 hours later
- Data auto-syncs to Supabase
- **Zero interruption to care**

## 💰 PWA vs Native App - Cost Savings

| Feature | Native App (iOS + Android) | PWA (Your Approach) |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Development** | Build twice (Swift + Kotlin) | Build once (React) |
| **Cost** | $50K-$150K | $0 (already built) |
| **Updates** | Submit to app stores (3-7 days review) | Deploy instantly (0 wait) |
| **Maintenance** | 2x code, 2x bugs | 1x code |
| **Install** | Download from app store (30-50 MB) | Visit URL, add to home (instant) |
| **Offline** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **Background geofencing** | ✅ Works | ❌ Not possible |
| **Background notifications** | ✅ Works | ⚠️ Limited |

**Your Strategy (SMART):**
- **PWA for providers** (complex workflows, desktop-first)
- **React Native for patients** (24/7 monitoring, geofencing)
- **Best of both worlds**

## 🔍 Technical Details (For Developers)

### Service Worker Strategy:

**File:** `public/service-worker.js`

**Caching strategy:**
- **App shell:** Cache-first (instant load)
- **API calls:** Network-first with fallback (fresh data when online)
- **Static assets:** Cache-first (images, CSS, JS)

**Cache versioning:**
```javascript
const VERSION = 'wellfit-v5.0.1';
const SHELL_CACHE = `shell-${VERSION}`;
const RUNTIME_CACHE = `runtime-${VERSION}`;
```

**Smart bypass (important!):**
Never caches these routes:
- `/login`, `/register` (auth flows)
- `/auth/callback` (OAuth)
- `/hcaptcha` (captcha verification)
- `/api/auth` (Supabase auth)

**Why:** Auth must always hit server (can't cache tokens)

---

### Offline Storage Implementation:

**File:** `src/utils/offlineStorage.ts`

**What gets stored:**
- Health check-ins (self-reports)
- Vitals measurements
- Form submissions
- Sync queue

**Storage tech:**
- IndexedDB (browser database)
- 50+ MB storage available
- Encrypted by browser
- Survives browser close

**Auto-sync logic:**
```typescript
// When online
window.addEventListener('online', async () => {
  const pending = await getPendingReports();
  for (const report of pending) {
    await syncToSupabase(report);
    await markAsSynced(report.id);
  }
});
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### "Service worker not registering"

**Symptoms:**
- DevTools → Application → Service Workers shows "No service worker"
- App doesn't work offline

**Fixes:**
1. **Check HTTPS:** Service workers ONLY work on HTTPS (except localhost)
   - ❌ `http://example.com` - Won't work
   - ✅ `https://example.com` - Works
   - ✅ `http://localhost` - Works (exception)

2. **Check allowed hosts:**
   Open `src/serviceWorkerRegistration.ts`, find:
   ```typescript
   const ALLOWED_HOSTS = new Set<string>([
     'wellfitcommunity.live',
     'www.wellfitcommunity.live',
     'localhost',
     '127.0.0.1',
   ]);
   ```
   **Add your domain if missing!**

3. **Check kill switches:**
   - URL: Remove `?nosw` or `?disable_sw` from URL
   - LocalStorage: Open console, run:
     ```javascript
     localStorage.removeItem('WF_DISABLE_SW');
     location.reload();
     ```

---

### "App not working offline"

**Symptoms:**
- Service worker registered
- But going offline shows "No internet" error

**Fixes:**
1. **Visit app once while online first**
   - Service worker needs to cache app
   - First visit must be online
   - Subsequent visits work offline

2. **Hard refresh to clear cache:**
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - This forces new service worker install

3. **Check cache:**
   - DevTools → Application → Cache Storage
   - Should see: `shell-wellfit-v5.0.1` and `runtime-wellfit-v5.0.1`

---

### "Data not syncing when back online"

**Symptoms:**
- Saved data offline
- Went back online
- Data still shows "pending"

**Fixes:**
1. **Check network tab:**
   - DevTools → Network
   - Look for failed POST requests to Supabase
   - Check error message

2. **Manual sync:**
   - Click offline indicator (bottom-left)
   - Click "Sync Now" button

3. **Check auth:**
   - User might have been logged out
   - Re-login should trigger sync
