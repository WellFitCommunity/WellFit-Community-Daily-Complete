## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Logging a Readmission

```typescript
import { ReadmissionTrackingService } from './services/readmissionTrackingService';

const readmission = await ReadmissionTrackingService.logReadmissionEvent({
  patient_id: 'user-uuid-here',
  admission_date: '2025-10-04',
  facility_name: 'General Hospital',
  facility_type: 'er',
  primary_diagnosis_code: 'I50.9',
  primary_diagnosis_description: 'Heart failure, unspecified'
});

// System automatically:
// 1. Detects if this is a readmission
// 2. Calculates risk score
// 3. Flags as high utilizer if applicable
// 4. Creates care team alert
// 5. Generates AI care plan if high risk
```

### Example 2: Sending Daily Check-In

```typescript
import { PatientOutreachService } from './services/patientOutreachService';

const checkIn = await PatientOutreachService.sendDailyCheckIn(
  'patient-uuid',
  'sms' // or 'app'
);

// SMS sent to patient's phone
// Check-in record created in database
// Awaiting patient response
```

### Example 3: Recording Check-In Response

```typescript
import { PatientOutreachService } from './services/patientOutreachService';

const response = await PatientOutreachService.recordCheckInResponse(
  'check-in-uuid',
  {
    feeling: 8,           // Scale 1-10
    medication_taken: true,
    pain_level: 2,
    emergency_symptoms: false,
    concerns: "Feeling much better today!"
  }
);

// System automatically:
// 1. Analyzes responses for concerning patterns
// 2. Triggers alerts if needed
// 3. Uses AI to generate clinical summary
// 4. Notifies care team if action required
```

### Example 4: Creating a Care Plan

```typescript
import { CareCoordinationService } from './services/careCoordinationService';

const carePlan = await CareCoordinationService.createCarePlan({
  patient_id: 'patient-uuid',
  plan_type: 'readmission_prevention',
  status: 'active',
  priority: 'high',
  title: 'Readmission Prevention Plan - CHF',
  start_date: '2025-10-04',
  next_review_date: '2025-10-11', // 7 days
  goals: [
    {
      goal: 'Prevent 30-day readmission',
      target: 'Zero ER visits or readmissions',
      timeframe: '30 days'
    },
    {
      goal: 'Medication adherence',
      target: '100% compliance',
      timeframe: '14 days'
    }
  ],
  interventions: [
    {
      intervention: 'Daily check-in calls',
      frequency: 'daily for 7 days',
      responsible: 'care_coordinator'
    },
    {
      intervention: 'Medication reconciliation',
      frequency: 'within 48 hours',
      responsible: 'pharmacist'
    }
  ]
});
```

### Example 5: Identifying High Utilizers

```typescript
import { ReadmissionTrackingService } from './services/readmissionTrackingService';

// Get high utilizers from last 30 days
const highUtilizers = await ReadmissionTrackingService.identifyHighUtilizers(30);

console.log(`Found ${highUtilizers.length} high utilizers`);

highUtilizers.forEach(patient => {
  console.log(`
    Patient: ${patient.patient_id}
    Risk: ${patient.risk_category}
    ER Visits: ${patient.er_visits}
    Readmissions: ${patient.readmissions}
    CMS Risk: ${patient.cms_penalty_risk ? 'YES' : 'NO'}
  `);
});

// Data automatically saved to high_utilizer_analytics table
```

## AI Configuration

### Claude Models Used

The system uses intelligent model selection based on task complexity:

1. **Health Questions (Nurse Panel):**
   - Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
   - Use case: Complex clinical responses
   - Cost: ~$0.003 per 1K input tokens

2. **Check-In Analysis:**
   - Model: Claude Sonnet 3.5
   - Use case: Pattern detection and summaries
   - Cost: ~$0.003 per 1K input tokens

3. **Care Plan Generation:**
   - Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
   - Use case: Comprehensive planning
   - Cost: ~$0.003 per 1K input tokens

### Cost Management

Built-in cost controls:
- **Daily limit:** $50 per user
- **Monthly limit:** $500 per user
- **Rate limiting:** 60 requests per minute
- **Circuit breaker:** Auto-disables on repeated failures
- **Cost tracking:** All API calls tracked with token counts

### Prompt Engineering

All prompts follow best practices:
- Clear role definition ("As a registered nurse...")
- Structured context (patient data, SDOH factors)
- Specific output requirements (JSON format, 2-3 sentences)
- Safety guidelines (never diagnose, recommend MD follow-up)

---

## Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance

✅ **Encryption at Rest:** Supabase uses AES-256
✅ **Encryption in Transit:** TLS 1.2+
✅ **Row Level Security (RLS):** All tables have RLS policies
✅ **Audit Logging:** All actions logged with user ID and timestamp
✅ **Access Controls:** Role-based permissions (admin, nurse, patient)
✅ **PHI Protection:** No PHI sent to external APIs without consent

### RLS Policies

Every table has production-grade RLS:

```sql
-- Admins see all, patients see their own
CREATE POLICY "patient_readmissions_admin_rw_patient_r"
ON patient_readmissions
USING (
  is_admin(auth.uid()) OR patient_id = auth.uid()
)
WITH CHECK (
  is_admin(auth.uid())
);
```

### AI Safety

- Patient data anonymized when possible
- AI responses reviewed by nurses before sending
- Emergency symptoms trigger immediate escalation
- AI suggestions never replace clinical judgment
- All AI interactions logged for audit

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Readmission Rates:**
   - 7-day readmission rate
   - 30-day readmission rate
   - 90-day readmission rate
   - Trend over time

2. **High Utilizer Patterns:**
   - Number of high utilizers identified
   - ER visit frequency
   - Common diagnoses
   - Intervention effectiveness

3. **Care Plan Success:**
   - Plans created vs completed
   - Goal achievement rates
   - Average plan duration
   - Patient satisfaction

4. **Check-In Engagement:**
   - Response rate (target: >80%)
   - Average response time
   - Alert trigger rate
   - Escalation rate

5. **CMS Penalty Risk:**
   - Patients at risk
   - Estimated penalty amount
   - Prevented readmissions (savings)
   - Compliance rate

### Dashboard Queries

```sql
-- CMS 30-day readmission rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE readmission_category = '30_day') as readmissions_30day,
  COUNT(*) as total_admissions,
  (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE readmission_category = '30_day')::float / COUNT(*) * 100) as readmission_rate
FROM patient_readmissions
WHERE admission_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';

-- High utilizers trend
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) as week,
  COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) as high_utilizers
FROM high_utilizer_analytics
WHERE overall_risk_category IN ('high', 'very_high')
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week DESC;

-- Care plan effectiveness
SELECT
  plan_type,
  COUNT(*) as total_plans,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed,
  AVG(EXTRACT(DAY FROM (end_date - start_date))) as avg_duration_days
FROM care_coordination_plans
GROUP BY plan_type;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Check-Ins Not Sending

**Symptoms:** Patients not receiving SMS check-ins

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Twilio configuration
echo $REACT_APP_TWILIO_ENABLED
echo $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID

# Verify patient has valid phone number
SELECT id, phone FROM profiles WHERE id = 'patient-uuid';

# Check check-in logs
SELECT * FROM patient_daily_check_ins
WHERE patient_id = 'patient-uuid'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

#### 2. AI Responses Failing

**Symptoms:** Nurse question suggestions show "temporarily unavailable"

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check API key
echo $REACT_APP_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Test Claude service
import { claudeService } from './services/claudeService';
const test = await claudeService.testConnection();
console.log(test);

# Check cost limits
// View in Supabase: claude_usage_tracking table
```

#### 3. Readmission Not Auto-Detected

**Symptoms:** Readmission not flagged correctly

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Verify previous discharge exists
SELECT * FROM patient_readmissions
WHERE patient_id = 'patient-uuid'
  AND discharge_date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY discharge_date DESC
LIMIT 1;

// Check date calculation
// Days between discharge and new admission
```

#### 4. Care Plan Not Created

**Symptoms:** High-risk event doesn't trigger care plan

**Solutions:**
```typescript
// Check risk score threshold
// Care plans only auto-create for risk_score >= 70

// Verify care plan doesn't already exist
SELECT * FROM care_coordination_plans
WHERE patient_id = 'patient-uuid'
  AND status = 'active';

// Check error logs
```
