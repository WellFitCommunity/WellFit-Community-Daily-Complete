[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is an open source Firebase alternative. We're building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade open source tools.

This repository contains all the functionality for Supabase CLI.

- [x] Running Supabase locally
- [x] Managing database migrations
- [x] Creating and deploying Supabase Functions
- [x] Generating types directly from your database schema
- [x] Making authenticated HTTP requests to [Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction)

## Getting started

### Install the CLI

Available via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) as dev dependency. To install:

```bash
npm i supabase --save-dev
```

To install the beta release channel:

```bash
npm i supabase@beta --save-dev
```

When installing with yarn 4, you need to disable experimental fetch with the following nodejs config.

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-fetch yarn add supabase
```

> **Note**
For Bun versions below v1.0.17, you must add `supabase` as a [trusted dependency](https://bun.sh/guides/install/trusted) before running `bun add -D supabase`.

  To install:

  ```sh
  brew install supabase/tap/supabase
  ```

  To upgrade:

  ```sh
  brew upgrade supabase
  ```

  #### via Linux packages

  Linux packages are provided in [Releases](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases). To install, download the `.apk`/`.deb`/`.rpm`/`.pkg.tar.zst` file depending on your package manager and run the respective commands.

  ```sh
  sudo apk add --allow-untrusted <...>.apk
  ```

  ```sh
  sudo dpkg -i <...>.deb
  ```

  ```sh
  sudo rpm -i <...>.rpm
  ```

  ```sh
  sudo pacman -U <...>.pkg.tar.zst
  ```

  <summary><b>Other Platforms</b></summary>

  You can also install the CLI via [go modules](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-install) without the help of package managers.

  ```sh
  go install github.com/supabase/cli@latest
  ```

  Add a symlink to the binary in `$PATH` for easier access:

  ```sh
  ln -s "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/cli" /usr/bin/supabase
  ```

  This works on other non-standard Linux distros.

  <summary><b>Community Maintained Packages</b></summary>

  Available via [pkgx](https://pkgx.sh/). Package script [here](https://github.com/pkgxdev/pantry/blob/main/projects/supabase.com/cli/package.yml).

### Run the CLI

```bash
supabase bootstrap
```

Or using npx:

```bash
npx supabase bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command will guide you through the process of setting up a Supabase project using one of the [starter](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-samples/blob/main/samples.json) templates.

## Docs

Command & config reference can be found [here](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/about).

## Breaking changes

We follow semantic versioning for changes that directly impact CLI commands, flags, and configurations.

However, due to dependencies on other service images, we cannot guarantee that schema migrations, seed.sql, and generated types will always work for the same CLI major version. If you need such guarantees, we encourage you to pin a specific version of CLI in package.json.

## Developing

To run from source:

```sh
# Go >= 1.22
go run . help
```
# Redeploy trigger

## Project Features

### Doctor's View (`/doctors-view`)
*   **Purpose:** Allows users (presumably seniors or patients) to see a summary of their recent health check-ins and self-reported data. It also provides a way for them to see if their data has been reviewed by a care team.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Displays the latest check-in notes.
    *   Shows recent self-reported health entries (mood, symptoms, activity).
    *   Indicates the review status of these items.
    *   Includes a feature for the user to submit a question to their care team. This relies on the `user_questions` table in the database.

### Self-Reporting Page (`/self-reporting`)
*   **Purpose:** Provides a dedicated page for users to easily report on their current health status, including mood, symptoms, and daily activities.
*   **Senior-Friendly Design:**
    *   Uses large, readable fonts and clear, simple language.
    *   Ensures high color contrast for better visibility.
    *   Features large, easy-to-click buttons and intuitive form elements (e.g., dropdown for mood).
    *   Overall layout is spacious and uncluttered to reduce cognitive load.
*   **Brand Integration:** Leverages the application's branding configuration for a consistent look and feel.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Allows selection of mood from predefined options.
    *   Provides text areas for describing symptoms and activities.
    *   Submits this information to the `health_entries` table in the database.

### Data Flow: Self-Reporting to Doctor's View
*   Data entered on the `SelfReportingPage` is saved as a `health_entries` record in the Supabase database with an `entry_type` of `'self_report'`.
*   The `DoctorsView` page fetches all `health_entries` for the logged-in user and displays them, including those from the `SelfReportingPage`. The view is designed to specifically format these `'self_report'` entries for clarity.

### Important Database Note: `user_questions` Table
*   A new table, `user_questions`, is required for the "Ask a Question" feature in the Doctor's View.
*   A migration file (e.g., `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_user_questions_table.sql`) has been created.
*   **Action Required:** To apply this database change, run the command `supabase db push` in your project's Supabase environment. Without this, the "Ask a Question" feature will not function correctly.
