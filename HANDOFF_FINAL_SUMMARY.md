## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Migrations
```bash
cd /workspaces/WellFit-Community-Daily-Complete
npx supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Encryption Key
Make sure `PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set in your environment:
```bash
# .env
PHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-32-byte-key
```

### Step 3: Ensure Encryption Initialization
In your `App.tsx`:
```typescript
import { initializePHIEncryption } from './lib/phi-encryption';

useEffect(() => {
  initializePHIEncryption();
}, []);
```

### Step 4: Add Routes (Optional)
```typescript
// For public sender portal
<Route path="/handoff/send" element={<LiteSenderPortal />} />

// For receiving facilities
<Route path="/handoff/receive" element={<ReceivingDashboard />} />
```

### Step 5: Test
1. Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí "Patient Handoff System" section
2. Create test transfer at `/handoff/send`
3. View in Admin Panel and export to Excel

## üé® White-Label Compatible

- ‚úÖ **No tenant_id required** - Uses user-level RLS
- ‚úÖ **Facility names freetext** - Works for any tenant
- ‚úÖ **Shared database** - All tenants use same tables
- ‚úÖ **Branding-neutral** - Inherits tenant colors

Example usage:
```typescript
// Houston tenant
<LiteSenderPortal facilityName="Houston Senior Care" />

// Miami tenant
<LiteSenderPortal facilityName="Miami WellFit Hospital" />
```
