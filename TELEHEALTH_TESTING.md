## 🧪 Integration Testing Guide

### End-to-End Test Scenario

**Scenario: Provider schedules appointment, patient receives notification and joins call**

#### Step 1: Provider Schedules Appointment

```typescript
// Test user story: Physician schedules telehealth visit
1. Navigate to /physician-dashboard
2. Expand "Telehealth Video Appointments" section
3. Search for patient "John Doe"
4. Select patient from results
5. Choose date: Tomorrow
6. Choose time: 2:00 PM
7. Select duration: 30 minutes
8. Select type: Regular Visit
9. Add reason: "Follow-up visit"
10. Click "Schedule Appointment & Send Notification"

Expected Results:
✅ Appointment created in database
✅ SMS sent to patient's phone
✅ Push notification sent (if registered)
✅ Success message displayed
✅ Appointment appears in provider's list
```

#### Step 2: Patient Receives Notification

```typescript
// Test user story: Patient receives and views appointment
1. Patient receives SMS: "Hi John! You have a video appointment..."
2. Patient opens app
3. Dashboard shows banner: "Upcoming Video Visit"
4. Patient clicks "View Details" or navigates to My Health Records
5. Clicks "My Appointments" tile
6. Sees upcoming appointment with countdown

Expected Results:
✅ SMS received on patient's phone
✅ Banner visible on dashboard
✅ Appointment visible in list
✅ Countdown timer accurate
✅ Provider name and time correct
```

#### Step 3: Patient Joins Call

```typescript
// Test user story: Patient joins video call
1. 15 minutes before appointment time
2. "Join Video Call" button appears (green, animated)
3. Patient clicks "Join Video Call"
4. TelehealthConsultation component launches
5. Daily.co room created/joined
6. Video/audio connected

Expected Results:
✅ Join button appears at correct time
✅ Video call launches
✅ Audio/video working
✅ Provider can join same call
✅ Call controls functional (mute/video/end)
```

## 🔥 Load Testing (Optional)

### Concurrent Appointment Scheduling

Test that system handles multiple simultaneous appointment creations:

```sql
-- Simulate 10 concurrent appointment creations
BEGIN;
  INSERT INTO telehealth_appointments (patient_id, provider_id, appointment_time, encounter_type, status)
  SELECT
    (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE role_code = 4 ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 1),
    (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE role_code = 5 ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 1),
    NOW() + interval '1 day' + (random() * interval '8 hours'),
    (ARRAY['outpatient', 'urgent-care', 'er'])[floor(random() * 3 + 1)],
    'scheduled'
  FROM generate_series(1, 10);
COMMIT;

-- Verify all created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM telehealth_appointments WHERE created_at > NOW() - interval '1 minute';
```
