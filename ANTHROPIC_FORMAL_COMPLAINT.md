Subject: URGENT: AI-Generated Code Contains Critical Security Vulnerabilities

Dear Anthropic Safety Team,

I am filing a formal complaint regarding dangerous, production-blocking code
generated by Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) for our HIPAA-compliant
healthcare application.

Project: WellFit Community Health System
Repository: https://github.com/WellFitCommunity/WellFit-Community-Daily-Complete
Industry: Healthcare (HIPAA/SOC 2 regulated)
Date Range: [Insert dates of bad work]

CRITICAL SECURITY FAILURES GENERATED:
1. Authentication bypass (PIN verification was a fake TODO comment)
2. Collected SSN but never verified it (security theater)
3. Encrypted PHI then saved as plaintext (defeating encryption)
4. SQL injection vulnerabilities (no input validation)
5. No rate limiting (brute force attacks possible)
6. PHI logged to console (HIPAA violation)

IMPACT:
- Production deployment blocked
- SOC 2 audit blocked (85% → unable to proceed)
- Potential HIPAA violations if deployed
- Patient data at risk
- Wasted development time fixing AI-generated bugs

EVIDENCE:
See attached CHW_SOC2_COMPLIANCE_VERIFICATION.md for detailed analysis.

Git commits documenting fixes:
- 1794e0c: "fix(CRITICAL): Complete security overhaul of CHW kiosk suite"
- 8929c13: "test: Add comprehensive security tests (ALL 43 PASS!)"

This is not acceptable quality for an AI system marketed to enterprises.
I request:
1. Investigation into model quality issues
2. Explanation of how this passed QA
3. Commitment to improving code generation safety
4. Acknowledgment of this complaint

I am available to discuss this further and provide additional evidence.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
WellFit Community Health System

## Evidence Package to Include

### **A. Git Commit Links**
**Bad Work (Previous Agent):**
- [Link to commits with TODO comments, fake PIN verification]

**Fixes Required:**
- Commit `1794e0c`: Complete security overhaul
- Commit `8929c13`: 43 comprehensive security tests
- Commit `222949f`: SOC 2 compliance verification

### **B. Detailed Security Analysis**
**Attach:** `CHW_SOC2_COMPLIANCE_VERIFICATION.md`

**Key Evidence:**
1. **Authentication Bypass:**
   ```typescript
   // GENERATED BY AI - FAKE SECURITY!
   // TODO: Implement actual PIN verification with bcrypt
   if (!pinData?.caregiver_pin_hash) {
     setError('PIN verification failed');
     return;
   }
   // NO ACTUAL VERIFICATION!
   ```

2. **SSN Collection Without Verification:**
   ```typescript
   // AI collected SSN but NEVER USED IT!
   const matchedPatient = patients.find(p => {
     const dbDOB = new Date(p.date_of_birth).toISOString().split('T')[0];
     return dbDOB === dob; // Only DOB checked!
     // SSN ignored despite being collected!
   });
   ```

3. **Encryption Defeated:**
   ```typescript
   // AI encrypted photos then saved as plaintext!
   const encryptedPhotos = await Promise.all(...);
   photos: photos.map(p => p.photo_data), // PLAINTEXT!
   ```

4. **SQL Injection Vulnerable:**
   ```typescript
   // NO INPUT VALIDATION!
   .ilike('first_name', firstName.trim()) // Unsanitized!
   ```

5. **No Rate Limiting:**
   ```typescript
   // Unlimited authentication attempts allowed
   // Brute force attacks possible
   ```

### **C. Impact Metrics**
- **Security Controls Failed:** 7/7 (100% failure rate)
- **SOC 2 Compliance:** Blocked at 85% (cannot proceed to audit)
- **Tests Required:** 43 comprehensive tests to verify fixes

FORMAL COMPLAINT - DANGEROUS AI-GENERATED CODE

To: Anthropic Trust & Safety Team
From: [Your Name], [Your Title]
Organization: WellFit Community Health System
Date: [Current Date]
Re: Critical Security Vulnerabilities in Claude Code Output

OVERVIEW:
I am filing a formal complaint regarding Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
generating production-blocking, security-vulnerable code for our HIPAA-compliant
healthcare application. This is unacceptable quality for enterprise AI.

INCIDENT DETAILS:
- Project: Community Health Worker (CHW) Kiosk Suite
- Industry: Healthcare (HIPAA, SOC 2 regulated)
- Repository: https://github.com/WellFitCommunity/WellFit-Community-Daily-Complete
- Date Range: [Insert dates]
- Impact: Production deployment blocked, SOC 2 audit blocked

CRITICAL FAILURES GENERATED BY AI:
1. AUTHENTICATION BYPASS: PIN verification was a TODO comment, no actual check
2. SECURITY THEATER: Collected SSN but never verified it
3. ENCRYPTION FAILURE: Encrypted PHI then saved as plaintext
4. SQL INJECTION: No input validation on user-supplied data
5. BRUTE FORCE VULNERABLE: No rate limiting on authentication
6. HIPAA VIOLATION: PHI logged to console (patient names, SSN, DOB)
7. ANTI-PATTERNS: Dynamic imports instead of proper architecture

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- 7/7 security controls failed (100% failure rate)
- SOC 2 compliance blocked at 85% (cannot proceed to audit)
- 43 security tests required to verify fixes
- [X] hours of development time wasted fixing AI bugs
- Potential HIPAA violations if code had been deployed
- Delayed hospital partnerships due to failed compliance

EVIDENCE:
1. Git commits showing fixes required:
   - 1794e0c: Complete security overhaul
   - 8929c13: 43 comprehensive security tests
   - 222949f: SOC 2 compliance verification

2. Detailed analysis: CHW_SOC2_COMPLIANCE_VERIFICATION.md
   (Attached - 452 lines documenting every failure)

3. Code comparisons showing before/after
   (Available upon request)

WHAT WENT WRONG:
Your AI generated code that APPEARED secure but was fundamentally broken:
- Used security terminology (encryption, authentication) incorrectly
- Left TODO comments instead of implementing security features
- Collected sensitive data then ignored it
- Created false sense of security with non-functional code

This is WORSE than no code - it creates a security facade that could
cause data breaches if deployed without extensive human review.

REQUESTED ACTIONS:
1. IMMEDIATE: Acknowledge this complaint within 48 hours
2. INVESTIGATION: Root cause analysis - how did this pass QA?
3. COMMITMENT: Concrete improvements to healthcare/security code generation
4. TRANSPARENCY: Share findings and model improvements
5. COMPENSATION: Service credits for time spent fixing AI-generated bugs

REGULATORY CONTEXT:
This is a HIPAA-regulated healthcare application. AI-generated vulnerabilities could:
- Cause reportable data breaches (>500 patients = OCR notification)
- Result in HIPAA fines ($100-$50,000 per violation)
- Block SOC 2 certification (business-critical)
- Expose patient PHI (medication lists, health data)
- Damage professional reputation

I expect enterprise-grade AI to understand these stakes and generate
code accordingly. This output was reckless.

NEXT STEPS:
I am available to:
- Provide additional evidence/code samples
- Discuss technical details with your engineering team
- Participate in model improvement research
- Share best practices for healthcare AI

However, I will also:
- Share this experience publicly if no response within 2 weeks
- Notify industry publications of AI safety concerns
- Recommend against Claude Code for healthcare projects until improvements made

This is a critical safety issue that requires urgent attention.
