# WellFit + Envision Atlus
## Raise Your CMS Star Ratings. Reduce Readmissions. Engage Patients Beyond Your Walls.

---

## The Problem

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Readmissions** | CMS penalties up to 3% of Medicare payments |
| **Star Ratings** | Published publicly - patients choose hospitals based on stars |
| **Post-Discharge Gap** | Epic tracks the hospital. Nothing tracks the patient at HOME. |
| **SDOH Screening** | Nurses skip it - too many questions, not enough time |
| **Caregiver Burnout** | Families can't access patient info without IT tickets |

---

## The Solution

**WellFit** is a community engagement platform that tracks patients AFTER discharge.

**Envision Atlus** is a clinical care engine that alerts your team BEFORE problems become readmissions.

## 3 Features Epic Can't Match

### 1. Community-to-Clinical Bridge
Patient checks in daily from home. Mood drops, meals skipped, meds missed → automatic alert to your care coordinator. **Catch problems on Day 3, not Day 14 in the ER.**

### 2. Caregiver Access in 30 Seconds
No portal registration. No IT tickets. No proxy forms. Senior shares a 4-digit PIN → daughter sees mom's health status immediately. Full HIPAA audit trail.

### 3. Passive SDOH Detection
We don't ask 47 screening questions. We LISTEN to daily check-ins:
- "Couldn't get to the pharmacy" → Transportation flag
- "Skipped meals this week" → Food insecurity flag
- "Feeling lonely" → Social isolation flag

**Automatic referrals to social work. No nurse burden.**

| SDOH screening completion | 30% | 90%+ (passive detection) |
