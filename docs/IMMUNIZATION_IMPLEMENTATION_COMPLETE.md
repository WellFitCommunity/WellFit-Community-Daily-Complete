## 🎯 What Was Delivered

### 1. Comprehensive FHIR R4 Immunization System

**Database Migration:** `20251017130000_fhir_immunizations.sql` ✅ DEPLOYED

**Features:**
- **50+ fields** covering all FHIR R4 Immunization specification requirements
- **US Core compliant** with required fields: status, vaccine code (CVX), patient, occurrence, primary source
- **Vaccine series tracking:** Dose number (e.g., dose 1 of 2) and total doses in series
- **Adverse reaction tracking:** Reaction date, details, and reporting
- **Administration details:** Site (left arm, right arm), route (IM, SC), dose quantity
- **Performer tracking:** Who administered the vaccine
- **Location tracking:** Where vaccine was administered (clinic, pharmacy)
- **Status reasons:** Why vaccine was not given (if status != completed)
- **Row Level Security** policies for patients, staff, pharmacists, admins
- **10 optimized indexes** for fast queries on patient, vaccine code, date, status

### 2. Database Helper Functions

**5 Powerful Functions:**

1. **`get_patient_immunizations(patient_id, days)`**
   - Returns immunization history for a patient
   - Filter by time window (e.g., last 365 days)
   - Includes dose numbers, lot numbers, performers

2. **`get_immunizations_by_vaccine(patient_id, vaccine_code)`**
   - Get all doses of a specific vaccine (e.g., all COVID vaccines)
   - Useful for tracking series completion
   - Returns dose numbers and status

3. **`check_vaccine_due(patient_id, vaccine_code, months_since_last)`**
   - Boolean check if vaccine is due
   - Configurable time window (e.g., flu shot due if >12 months)
   - Perfect for care gap alerts

4. **`get_vaccine_gaps(patient_id)`**
   - **⭐ STAR FEATURE** - Identifies all missing/due vaccines
   - Pre-configured for senior population:
     - Annual flu vaccine
     - Annual COVID booster
     - Shingles vaccine (one-time)
     - Pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13, PPSV23)
     - Tdap booster (every 10 years)
   - Returns recommendations with months since last dose
   - **Revenue opportunity:** Drive preventive care visits

### 3. TypeScript Type Safety

**File:** [src/types/fhir.ts](../src/types/fhir.ts) (lines 598-724)

**Exports:**
- `FHIRImmunization` interface with 40+ typed fields
- `SENIOR_VACCINE_CODES` constant with common CVX codes
- `VACCINE_NAMES` mapping for display (e.g., "Influenza (Flu Shot)")
- `IMMUNIZATION_ROUTES` for administration methods (IM, SC, PO, etc.)
- `IMMUNIZATION_SITES` for body sites (LA, RA, LD, RD, etc.)

**Common Vaccines Included:**
- `141` - Influenza (Flu Shot)
- `213` - COVID-19 Vaccine
- `121` - Shingles (Shingrix)
- `152` - Pneumococcal PCV13

- `113` - Td (Tetanus, Diphtheria)
- `43` - Hepatitis B
- `83` - Hepatitis A
- `03` - MMR

### 4. Service Layer

**File:** [src/services/fhirResourceService.ts](../src/services/fhirResourceService.ts) (lines 876-1062)

**ImmunizationService Methods:**

**Read Operations:**
- `getByPatient(patientId)` - All immunizations for a patient
- `getHistory(patientId, days)` - Filtered by time window
- `getByVaccineCode(patientId, vaccineCode)` - All doses of specific vaccine
- `getCompleted(patientId)` - Only completed immunizations
- `getById(id)` - Single immunization by ID
- `search(params)` - Advanced search with filters

**Care Gap Operations:**
- `checkVaccineDue(patientId, vaccineCode, months)` - Is vaccine due?

## 🎨 Common Use Cases

### Track Annual Flu Shots
```typescript
// Get all flu shots for patient
const fluShots = await FHIRService.Immunization.getByVaccineCode(
  patientId,
  SENIOR_VACCINE_CODES.FLU
);

// Check if flu shot is due (>12 months since last)
const fluDue = await FHIRService.Immunization.checkVaccineDue(
  patientId,
  SENIOR_VACCINE_CODES.FLU,
  12
);
```

### Identify Care Gaps
```typescript
// Get all missing/due vaccines for patient
const gaps = await FHIRService.Immunization.getVaccineGaps(patientId);

// Example output:
// [
//   {
//     vaccine_code: '141',
//     vaccine_name: 'Influenza, seasonal',
//     last_received_date: '2024-01-15',
//     months_since_last: 9,
//     recommendation: 'Annual flu vaccine recommended'
//   },
//   {
//     vaccine_code: '121',
//     vaccine_name: 'Zoster (Shingles)',
//     last_received_date: null,
//     months_since_last: null,
//     recommendation: 'One-time series for adults 50+'
//   }
// ]
```

### Record New Immunization
```typescript
await FHIRService.Immunization.create({
  patient_id: patientId,
  status: 'completed',
  vaccine_code: '141',
  vaccine_display: 'Influenza, seasonal, injectable',
  occurrence_datetime: new Date().toISOString(),
  primary_source: true,
  lot_number: 'LOT123456',
  site_code: 'LA',
  site_display: 'Left arm',
  route_code: 'IM',
  route_display: 'Intramuscular',
  dose_quantity_value: 0.5,
  dose_quantity_unit: 'mL',
  performer_actor_display: 'Jane Smith, RN',
  location_display: 'WellFit Community Health Center'
});
```

### Track Vaccine Series
```typescript
// COVID vaccine series (dose 2 of 2)
await FHIRService.Immunization.create({
  patient_id: patientId,
  status: 'completed',
  vaccine_code: '213',
  vaccine_display: 'COVID-19 Vaccine',
  occurrence_datetime: new Date().toISOString(),
  primary_source: true,
  protocol_dose_number_positive_int: 2, // Dose 2
  protocol_series_doses_positive_int: 2, // of 2
  protocol_target_disease: ['COVID-19'],
  protocol_target_disease_display: ['COVID-19']
});
```
