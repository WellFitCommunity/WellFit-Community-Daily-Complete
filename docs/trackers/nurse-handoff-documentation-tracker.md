# Feature 1 — Shift Handoff Dashboard

> **Problem:** AI-generated shift summaries exist in the database but nurses have no UI to view, manage, or act on them.

## Session 1: Core Dashboard — COMPLETE

| Feature | Status | What Was Built |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Dashboard component | BUILT (pre-existing) | `src/components/nurse/ShiftHandoffDashboard.tsx` — 916→400 lines (decomposed) |
| Unit filter | BUILT | Unit dropdown in HandoffHeader, queries `getAvailableUnits()` from `ai_shift_handoff_summaries` |
| Patient cards | BUILT (pre-existing) | High acuity + standard acuity sections with vitals, risk factors, clinical snapshots |
| Risk tier badges | BUILT (pre-existing) | Color-coded CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with icons |
| Handoff detail panel | BUILT | `AISummaryPanel` — expandable panel showing executive summary, critical alerts, medication alerts, behavioral concerns, pending tasks from `ai_shift_handoff_summaries` |
| Route wiring | BUILT (pre-existing) | `/shift-handoff` in routeConfig.ts with lazy import |
| Tests | BUILT | 12 tests (up from 5): header, patient cards, risk filters, unit filter, AI summary panel expand/content, clinical data, risk factors, acuity sections |
| Decomposition | BUILT | God file (916 lines) → thin orchestrator (400 lines) + 4 submodules in `shift-handoff/` |

**New files created:**
- `src/components/nurse/shift-handoff/types.ts` (51 lines)
- `src/components/nurse/shift-handoff/HandoffHeader.tsx` (182 lines)
- `src/components/nurse/shift-handoff/HighAcuitySection.tsx` (185 lines)
- `src/components/nurse/shift-handoff/StandardAcuitySection.tsx` (133 lines)
- `src/components/nurse/shift-handoff/AISummaryPanel.tsx` (186 lines)
- `src/components/nurse/shift-handoff/index.ts` (9 lines)

**Service additions:**
- `shiftHandoffService.ts`: Added `getAIShiftSummary()` and `getAvailableUnits()` + `AIShiftSummary` interface

**Data source:** `ai_shift_handoff_summaries` + `shift_handoff_risk_scores` + `shift_handoff_events`

## Session 2: Handoff Workflow — COMPLETE

| Feature | Status | What Was Built |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Acknowledge handoff | BUILT | "Acknowledge Summary" button on AISummaryPanel; calls `acknowledgeAIShiftSummary()` → updates `acknowledged_by`/`acknowledged_at` in DB |
| Override AI summary | BUILT | "Add Notes" / "Edit Notes" button opens inline textarea; saves to `handoff_notes` column via `updateAISummaryNotes()` with audit logging |
| Print/export view | BUILT | "Print Summary" button triggers `window.print()`; `@media print` CSS hides nav, modals, presence; forces summary content visible |
| Real-time updates | BUILT | Supabase realtime subscription on `ai_shift_handoff_summaries` INSERT/UPDATE events; auto-refreshes AI summary during shift change |
| Shift selector | BUILT | Day/Evening/Night toggle exists in HandoffHeader |
| Service decomposition | BUILT | `shiftHandoffService.ts` decomposed: 717→457 lines; scoring → `shiftHandoffScoring.ts`, time tracking → `shiftHandoffTimeTracking.ts` |
| Tests | BUILT | 18 tests (up from 12): acknowledge button, acknowledge service call, add notes button, print button, notes editor open, realtime subscription setup |

**New service methods:**
- `ShiftHandoffService.acknowledgeAIShiftSummary(summaryId)` — updates acknowledged_by/at
- `ShiftHandoffService.updateAISummaryNotes(summaryId, notes)` — updates handoff_notes

**New files created:**
- `src/services/shiftHandoffScoring.ts` (231 lines) — auto-scoring engine + helpers
- `src/services/shiftHandoffTimeTracking.ts` (112 lines) — time savings tracking

**Print styles added:** `src/index.css` — `@media print` block for shift handoff dashboard

## Session 3: Integration & Polish — COMPLETE

| Feature | Status | What Was Built |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Admin section wiring | BUILT | `lazyImports.tsx` + `sectionDefinitions.tsx` — ShiftHandoffDashboard registered in `patient-care` category with nurse/charge_nurse/admin roles |
| Notification bridge | BUILT | Realtime INSERT handler shows `EAAffirmationToast` ("New AI shift summary available") when new summary arrives |
| Avatar integration UI | PARTIAL | `AvatarThumbnail` already renders on patient cards (Session 1); markers remain `[]` pending patient avatar marker service endpoint |
| Audit logging | BUILT | `SHIFT_HANDOFF_DASHBOARD_VIEW` on mount, `SHIFT_HANDOFF_ACCEPTED` on accept, `SHIFT_HANDOFF_BYPASS_USED` (warn) on bypass, `HANDOFF_PRINT_REQUESTED` on print |
| Demo data | BUILT | `shift-handoff/demoData.ts` — 4 demo patients (Alpha/Bravo/Charlie/Delta), metrics, AI summary, units; `useDemoMode()` skips DB calls when active |
| Tests | BUILT | 21 tests (up from 18): audit logging on mount, print audit log, admin section wiring verification |

**New files created:**
- `src/components/nurse/shift-handoff/demoData.ts` (135 lines) — synthetic demo data for presentations

**Files modified:**
- `src/components/admin/sections/lazyImports.tsx` — added `ShiftHandoffDashboard` lazy import
- `src/components/admin/sections/sectionDefinitions.tsx` — added `shift-handoff` section definition
- `src/components/nurse/ShiftHandoffDashboard.tsx` (481→504 lines) — demo mode, audit logging, notification toast
- `src/components/nurse/__tests__/ShiftHandoffDashboard.test.tsx` (18→21 tests)

**Known gap:** Avatar markers (`markers={[]}`) need a service endpoint to fetch patient-specific avatar marker data from the database. This is a data flow feature, not a UI issue — the thumbnails render correctly.

# Feature 2 — Nurse Question Manager Backend

> **Problem:** UI component exists (742 lines in `NurseQuestionManager.tsx`) but runs entirely on mock data. No database tables, no RPC functions, no real backend.

## Session 1: Database & API Foundation — COMPLETE

| Feature | Status | What Was Built |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| `user_questions` table extension | BUILT | Added `tenant_id`, `assigned_nurse_id`, `claimed_at`, `escalated_at`, `escalation_level` columns; updated status constraint to include 'claimed'/'escalated' |
| `nurse_question_answers` table | BUILT | Nurse responses with `used_ai_suggestion`, `ai_suggestion_text`, `ai_confidence` tracking; tenant-scoped RLS |
| `nurse_question_notes` table | BUILT | Internal nurse notes (not patient-visible); tenant-scoped RLS |
| RLS policies | BUILT | `nurses_view_tenant_questions`, `nurses_update_assigned_questions` on user_questions; tenant-scoped view/insert on answers and notes tables |
| RPC functions | BUILT | `nurse_open_queue()`, `nurse_claim_question()`, `nurse_my_questions()`, `nurse_submit_answer()`, `nurse_add_note()`, `nurse_escalate_question()` |
| Migration file | BUILT | `20260224100000_nurse_question_system.sql` — applied to remote DB |
| Service layer | BUILT | `nurseQuestionService.ts` (310 lines) — ServiceResult pattern, 8 methods, full audit logging |
| API wrapper | BUILT | `nurseApi.ts` updated — delegates to service with legacy field mapping for backward compat |
| Tests | BUILT | 17 tests across 7 describe blocks: queue fetch, claim, my questions, submit answer, add note, escalate, notes/answers fetch, error handling |

**Discovery:** `user_questions` table already existed (created in `20250924000002_simple_user_questions_fix.sql`). Extended it with workflow columns instead of creating duplicate table. Three RPC functions had been previously dropped in `20251209110000_drop_broken_functions.sql` — all recreated.

**New files (3):**
- `supabase/migrations/20260224100000_nurse_question_system.sql` (268 lines)
- `src/services/nurseQuestionService.ts` (310 lines)
- `src/services/__tests__/nurseQuestionService.test.ts` (333 lines)

**Modified files (1):**
- `src/lib/nurseApi.ts` — rewritten to delegate to NurseQuestionService with legacy type mapping

## Session 2: Service Layer & UI Wiring — NOT STARTED

| Feature | Status | What Needs to Be Built |
|---------|--------|------------------------|
| `nurseQuestionService.ts` | MISSING | Service using ServiceResult pattern: fetch queue, claim, answer, escalate |
| Replace mock data | MISSING | Wire `NurseQuestionManager.tsx` to real service (remove hardcoded data) |
| `nurseApi.ts` completion | PARTIAL | Currently 50-line stub — needs real Supabase calls |
| AI suggestion integration | MISSING | Wire Claude for answer suggestions (register in `ai_skills`) |
| Queue assignment logic | MISSING | Auto-assign based on unit, specialty, or round-robin |
| Tests | MISSING | Service tests, UI integration tests |

## Session 3: Workflow & Notifications — NOT STARTED

| Feature | Status | What Needs to Be Built |
|---------|--------|------------------------|
| Escalation flow | MISSING | Question unanswered >2hrs auto-escalates to charge nurse |
| Patient notification | MISSING | Notify patient when question is answered (SMS/push) |
| Nurse notification | MISSING | Alert nurse when new question arrives in their queue |
| Analytics | MISSING | Response time metrics, volume by category, AI suggestion acceptance rate |
| Audit logging | MISSING | All question interactions logged via `auditLogger` |
| Tests | MISSING | Escalation timing, notification triggers, analytics queries |

---

## Estimated Effort

| Feature | Sessions | Hours |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Shift Handoff Dashboard (3 sessions) | 3 | ~12-16 |
| Nurse Question Manager Backend (3 sessions) | 3 | ~12-16 |
| **Total** | **6** | **~24-32** |

---

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| `ai_shift_handoff_summaries` table | BUILT | Dashboard reads from this |
| `shift_handoff_risk_scores` table | BUILT | Risk tier badges |
| SmartScribe nurse guardrails | BUILT | Nurse mode grounding rules (commit `2f9c43b2`) |
| `handoffRiskSynthesizer.ts` | BUILT | Generates the summaries dashboard will display |
| `NurseQuestionManager.tsx` UI | BUILT (mock) | Needs backend wiring, not rewrite |
| Module access system | BUILT | `useModuleAccess('shift_handoff')` |

---

## Notes

- Shift Handoff Dashboard is higher priority — infrastructure already generates data, just needs a UI
- Nurse Question Manager needs full backend build (tables + RPCs + service) before UI can be wired
- Both features serve the nurse persona and reduce documentation burden — core value proposition
- All new code must follow CLAUDE.md rules: no `any`, `auditLogger` only, `unknown` error handling, 600-line max
