### Features to Test:

1. **Behavioral Learning**
   - Dashboard tracks which sections you open/close
   - Learns your usage patterns over 30 days
   - Automatically prioritizes your most-used sections

2. **AI-Powered Insights** (Claude Haiku 4.5)
   - Analyzes your behavior patterns
   - Provides personalized welcome messages
   - Suggests relevant sections based on time of day
   - Detects workflow patterns

3. **Adaptive Layout**
   - Sections reorder based on usage frequency
   - "High Priority" badges for frequently-used sections
   - "Learning..." badges during initial usage
   - Collapsible sections remember your preferences

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Tracking (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Verify behavior tracking works

1. **Log in as test admin user**
   - Use your test account (not real patient data)

2. **Open the Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to `/admin` or wherever IntelligentAdminPanel is used

3. **Interact with sections:**
   - Open "Revenue Dashboard" - wait 10 seconds
   - Close it
   - Open "Patient Engagement" - wait 5 seconds
   - Close it
   - Open "Revenue Dashboard" again - wait 10 seconds

4. **Verify tracking in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     section_name,
     action,
     time_spent,
     created_at
   FROM admin_usage_tracking
   WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_TEST_USER_ID'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ 3+ rows in `admin_usage_tracking` table
- ‚úÖ Actions: 'open' entries for each section
- ‚úÖ `time_spent` values populated (in seconds)
- ‚úÖ No data from other users visible (RLS working)

---

### Test 2: Pattern Recognition (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Verify AI learns your behavior

1. **Create a usage pattern:**
   - Over 3-5 minutes, interact with the same 2-3 sections repeatedly
   - Example pattern:
     - Open "Revenue Dashboard" 5 times
     - Open "CCM Autopilot" 3 times
     - Open "Patient Engagement" 2 times

2. **Refresh the page**
   - The dashboard should reload with your pattern data

3. **Check for personalization:**
   - Look for "High Priority" badges on frequently-used sections
   - Check if sections reordered (most-used at top)
   - Look for personalized welcome message

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ "Revenue Dashboard" shows "High Priority" badge (most opened)
- ‚úÖ Welcome message mentions your frequently-used sections
- ‚úÖ Sections reordered by usage frequency
- ‚úÖ AI suggestions appear (e.g., "You often use Revenue Dashboard in the morning")

---

### Test 3: AI Insights (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Verify Claude Haiku 4.5 integration works

1. **Build up usage history:**
   - Interact with 5-7 different sections
   - Spend different amounts of time in each
   - Repeat over 2-3 sessions (log out/log back in)

2. **Check AI-generated content:**
   - Look for personalized welcome message (changes based on time of day)
   - Look for AI suggestions (e.g., "Based on your workflow...")
   - Check for "Learning..." badges on new sections

3. **Verify audit logging:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     request_type,
     model,
     input_tokens,
     output_tokens,
     cost,
     success,
     created_at
   FROM claude_usage_logs
   WHERE request_type = 'dashboard_prediction'
   AND user_id = 'YOUR_TEST_USER_ID'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Personalized welcome message (not generic)
- ‚úÖ AI suggestions based on your usage patterns
- ‚úÖ Audit log entries in `claude_usage_logs` table
- ‚úÖ Model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20250919`
- ‚úÖ Cost: ~$0.0001 per request (very cheap)
- ‚úÖ `success = true`

---

### Test 4: HIPAA Compliance (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Verify no PHI is stored or sent to Claude

1. **Create section with "bad" name (simulated PHI):**
   - This is a code-level test - you'd need to modify IntelligentAdminPanel.tsx
   - Try adding a test section with title: "Patient: John Doe john@test.com"

2. **Open that section**

3. **Check database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT section_name
   FROM admin_usage_tracking
   WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_TEST_USER_ID'
   AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Section name is sanitized to "generic-section" (PHI blocked)
- ‚úÖ Warning in browser console: "HIPAA: Blocked PHI in section name"
- ‚úÖ No email/phone/SSN visible in database

---

### Test 5: Multi-User Isolation (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Verify users can't see each other's data (RLS working)

1. **Log in as Test User A**
   - Interact with 3 sections

2. **Log out and log in as Test User B**
   - Interact with 2 different sections

3. **Check database for User A:**
   ```sql
   -- This query should ONLY return User A's data when run as User A
   SELECT user_id, section_name, COUNT(*)
   FROM admin_usage_tracking
   GROUP BY user_id, section_name;
   ```

4. **Try to query User B's data directly (should fail):**
   ```sql
   -- This should return 0 rows due to RLS
   SELECT * FROM admin_usage_tracking
   WHERE user_id = 'USER_B_UUID';
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ User A sees only their own data
- ‚úÖ User B sees only their own data
- ‚úÖ Cross-user query returns 0 rows (RLS blocking)
- ‚úÖ Admin users can see ALL data (admin policy working)

---

### Test 6: Error Handling (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Verify graceful degradation when AI fails

1. **Simulate AI failure:**
   - Temporarily remove/invalidate ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Supabase secrets
   - Or modify Edge Function to throw error

2. **Reload admin panel**

3. **Observe behavior:**
   - Dashboard should still load
   - Sections should still be usable
   - Fallback to pattern-based insights (no AI)

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads (doesn't crash)
- ‚úÖ Sections still track usage
- ‚úÖ Pattern-based sorting works (no AI needed)
- ‚úÖ Error logged in `claude_usage_logs` with `success = false`
- ‚úÖ Generic welcome message shown (no AI personalization)

---

## üîç What to Look For (Break It!)

### Good Behaviors ‚úÖ
- Dashboard loads quickly
- Sections reorder after 5-10 interactions
- Welcome message personalizes after 3+ sessions
- No lag when opening/closing sections
- Tracking happens silently (no user friction)

### Bad Behaviors ‚ùå (Report These!)
- Dashboard freezes or crashes
- Sections don't reorder even after 20+ interactions
- Welcome message stays generic forever
- Errors in browser console (check DevTools)
- Slow page loads (>3 seconds)
- Data from other users visible
- PHI visible in database (emails, names, etc.)
- Missing audit logs in `claude_usage_logs`

---

## üìä Database Queries for Testing

### Check Your Usage Data
```sql
SELECT
  section_name,
  action,
  time_spent,
  created_at
FROM admin_usage_tracking
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() -- Your ID
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Usage Analytics
```sql
SELECT
  section_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_opens,
  SUM(time_spent) as total_seconds,
  MAX(created_at) as last_used
FROM admin_usage_tracking
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
AND action = 'open'
GROUP BY section_name
ORDER BY total_opens DESC;
```

### Check AI Audit Logs
```sql
SELECT
  request_type,
  model,
  input_tokens,
  output_tokens,
  cost,
  response_time_ms,
  success,
  error_message,
  created_at
FROM claude_usage_logs
WHERE request_type = 'dashboard_prediction'
AND user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check RLS Policies (Admin Only)
```sql
-- This should return 0 rows if you're not an admin
SELECT *
FROM admin_usage_tracking
WHERE user_id != auth.uid();
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Edge Function not found"
**Fix:** Run deployment again:
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy claude-personalization --project-ref xkybsjnvuohpqpbkikyn
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" when inserting tracking data
**Fix:** Verify RLS policies:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'admin_usage_tracking';
```

### Issue: No AI insights appearing
**Fix:**
1. Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in Supabase secrets
2. Check `claude_usage_logs` for error messages
3. Verify Edge Function deployed successfully

### Issue: Sections not reordering
**Fix:**
1. Verify you've opened sections at least 5+ times
2. Check database has tracking data
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check browser console for errors
