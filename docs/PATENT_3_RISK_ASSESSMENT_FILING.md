## 📝 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (250 words)

A computer-implemented system and method for predicting patient health risks and clinical deterioration by analyzing community engagement patterns as supplemental indicators alongside traditional clinical data. The system collects clinical data from electronic health record (EHR) systems including diagnoses, medications, lab results, and healthcare utilization patterns, while simultaneously collecting community engagement data including daily health check-in completion rates, social interaction frequency with peers, community content consumption patterns, wellness activity participation, and family member engagement levels.

The system applies machine learning algorithms to identify previously unknown correlations between engagement pattern changes and clinical outcome deterioration. A composite risk score is generated by combining traditional clinical risk factors with community-derived behavioral indicators and social determinants of health data. The system detects early warning signals including sudden drops in check-in frequency (indicating potential health crisis or depression), decreased social interaction (indicating isolation or cognitive decline), reduced family member activity (indicating weakening support systems), and changes in content consumption patterns (indicating health literacy concerns or disengagement from care).

When engagement metrics decline below individualized baseline thresholds or predetermined population-based risk thresholds, the system automatically triggers proactive interventions including care team notifications, automated outreach to patients, social worker referrals for SDOH concerns, and care plan adjustments. The invention enables healthcare providers to identify at-risk patients before traditional clinical symptoms manifest, providing earlier intervention opportunities that reduce hospital readmissions, prevent emergency department visits, improve chronic disease management, and lower overall healthcare costs. The system's unique approach of treating community engagement as a clinical vital sign represents a paradigm shift in predictive healthcare analytics.

## 🎯 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

This invention relates to healthcare predictive analytics, specifically to systems and methods for predicting patient health risks by analyzing behavioral and social engagement patterns captured through community health platforms, and using said engagement data as clinical indicators alongside traditional medical data for early intervention and preventive care.

### Description of Related Art and Problems Solved

**Problem #1: Traditional Risk Assessment is Reactive, Not Proactive**

Conventional healthcare risk assessment systems rely exclusively on clinical data points including:
- **Lab results:** Require scheduled blood draws; reflect past metabolic state
- **Vital signs:** Only captured during clinic visits (intermittent snapshots)
- **Healthcare utilization:** Identify problems after they've already occurred (ER visits, hospitalizations)
- **Claims data:** Lag by weeks or months; reflect completed encounters
- **Diagnosis codes:** Static; don't reflect day-to-day patient status changes

**Consequence:** By the time traditional risk models flag a patient as high-risk, clinical deterioration has already begun. The patient may have already missed appointments, stopped taking medications, or experienced worsening symptoms for weeks before the healthcare system becomes aware.

**Problem #2: Behavioral and Social Risk Factors are Invisible**

Healthcare providers lack visibility into critical non-clinical risk factors:
- **Medication non-adherence:** Patients may stop taking medications but won't mention it until next appointment (30-90 days later)
- **Social isolation:** Loneliness and social withdrawal are strong predictors of health decline but are not captured in EHR systems
- **Depression and mental health:** Mood changes affect physical health but often go undetected between clinical encounters
- **Family support deterioration:** Weakening caregiver engagement leads to worse outcomes but is not measurable clinically
- **Health literacy decline:** Patients may become confused about care plans but won't proactively seek help

**Consequence:** Healthcare providers make care decisions with incomplete information, missing critical behavioral and social context that affects patient outcomes.

**Problem #3: No Early Warning System for Non-Acute Deterioration**

Current healthcare systems excel at detecting acute emergencies (heart attack, stroke) through physiological monitoring, but fail to detect gradual non-acute deterioration:
- Slowly worsening depression leading to self-neglect
- Gradual medication non-adherence leading to disease progression
- Increasing social isolation leading to cognitive decline
- Weakening family support leading to care plan failure

**Consequence:** Patients deteriorate slowly over weeks or months until reaching a crisis point requiring expensive emergency intervention (ER visit, hospitalization, nursing home placement).

**Problem #4: Hospital Readmission Penalties Without Effective Prediction Tools**

Under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), Medicare penalizes hospitals with higher-than-expected readmission rates, costing hospitals millions annually. Existing readmission prediction models (LACE score, HOSPITAL score) use only clinical and utilization data and have limited predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.60-0.70, barely better than chance).

**Consequence:** Hospitals lack effective tools to identify which discharged patients are at highest risk for readmission, leading to inefficient use of care management resources and continued financial penalties.

**Problem #5: Population Health Management Requires Daily Data, But Only Episodic Data Exists**

Value-based care models require continuous monitoring of patient populations to identify deteriorating patients early. However, most patients only interact with the healthcare system episodically (quarterly appointments, occasional lab draws), creating massive data gaps between encounters.

**Consequence:** Population health management programs cannot effectively stratify risk or deploy resources because they lack continuous real-time patient status data.

### Objects and Advantages of the Invention

The present invention overcomes these limitations by:

1. **Providing Continuous Daily Data:** Community engagement generates daily data points even when patients have no clinical encounters

2. **Detecting Pre-Clinical Deterioration:** Changes in engagement patterns serve as early warning signals before clinical symptoms emerge

3. **Capturing Behavioral Risk Factors:** Check-in patterns, medication adherence self-reports, and activity levels reveal behavioral health status

4. **Measuring Social Risk Factors:** Interaction frequency and family engagement quantify social support and isolation risk

5. **Enabling Proactive Intervention:** Automated alerts trigger outreach before patients reach crisis points

6. **Improving Readmission Prediction:** Adding engagement data to traditional models significantly improves predictive accuracy

7. **Supporting Value-Based Care:** Continuous risk stratification enables efficient deployment of care management resources

8. **Reducing Healthcare Costs:** Early intervention prevents expensive emergency visits and hospitalizations

9. **Improving Patient Outcomes:** Catching problems early leads to better clinical outcomes and quality of life

10. **Quantifying Previously Unmeasurable Factors:** Assigns numeric scores to concepts like "social isolation" and "family support" that were previously subjective

           patterns;

   d) Retrieving clinical data for said patient from electronic health record
      system including:
      i. Active diagnoses and chronic conditions;
      ii. Current medications and polypharmacy indicators;
      iii. Recent healthcare utilization including emergency visits and
           hospitalizations;
      iv. Laboratory results and vital signs;
      v. Social determinants of health flags;

   e) Generating a composite risk score by:
      i. Applying a machine learning model trained on historical data
         correlating engagement patterns with clinical outcomes;
