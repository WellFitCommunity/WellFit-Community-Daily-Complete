# Slide 2: The Problem - A Perfect Storm in Healthcare

## Three Massive, Converging Crises

### Crisis 1: Preventable Senior Hospitalizations
- **$250 billion/year** wasted on preventable hospitalizations
- **15-20%** of seniors readmitted within 30 days
- Hospitals lose **$50,000** per readmission (CMS penalties)
- **Root cause:** No early warning system for patient decline

### Crisis 2: Missing Critical Data
- **CMS now REQUIRES** SDOH (Social Determinants of Health) data collection
- **Medicare Advantage plans** lose $10B/year from poor Star ratings
- **EHRs don't capture** loneliness, falls, food insecurity, housing issues
- **Patient portals** have <5% daily engagement
- **The gap:** Seniors won't report this data in boring surveys

### Crisis 3: Provider Burnout
- **45-55%** nurse burnout rate
- **$52,000** cost to replace one nurse
- **CCM programs** waste 8+ hours/week on manual documentation
- **$2B/year** in CCM billing left on the table (90% leakage)

**Slide Visual:**
- Three columns with icons and stats
- Red highlighting the costs/waste
- Visual chart showing the gap between "Data Needed" vs "Data Available"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Healthcare is at an inflection point. Hospitals are bleeding money from preventable readmissions. CMS is demanding SDOH data that nobody can capture. And nurses are leaving in droves because of administrative burden. The current tools—patient portals, EHRs, wellness apps—all fail because they solve ONE piece of this puzzle. WellFit solves ALL THREE."

# Slide 4: The Market - $97B and Government-Mandated

## Not Speculative. Not Optional. REQUIRED by Law.

### Total Addressable Market (TAM): $97B/year

| Revenue Stream | Buyer | Market Size | Our Opportunity |
|----------------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **CCM/RPM Billing** | Medicare (auto-paid) | $2B/year | $20M ARR (Year 5) |
| **Hospital Risk Contracts** | Hospitals (MSSP) | $25B/year | $15M ARR (Year 5) |
| **MA Plan PMPM** | Medicare Advantage | $15B/year | $25M ARR (Year 5) |
| **SDOH Quality Bonuses** | CMS (via MA plans) | $50B/year | Embedded in PMPM |
| **AI Clinical Intelligence** | Health systems | $5B/year | $5M ARR (Year 5) |
| **TOTAL** | | **$97B/year** | **$65M ARR (Year 5)** |

### Regulatory Tailwinds (This is Mandatory)

1. **21st Century Cures Act**
   - REQUIRES EHRs to provide FHIR APIs
   - Hospitals face $1M+ fines for "information blocking"
   - **WellFit benefits:** Epic/Cerner can't block us

2. **CMS SDOH Mandate (2025)**
   - Medicare Advantage plans MUST collect SDOH data
   - Counts toward Star ratings (worth $1,000-$3,000/patient/year)
   - **WellFit captures this at 70%+ completion rate**

3. **Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)**
   - Hospitals penalized for readmissions
   - CCM/RPM billing reimbursed at $60-$120/patient/month
   - **WellFit automates billing capture (90% currently leaked)**

### Market Dynamics

- **55 million** Medicare beneficiaries in US
- **$1 trillion** shifting to value-based care by 2030
- **6,000** hospitals, **15,000** CCM programs
- **500 Medicare Advantage plans**

**Slide Visual:**
- Large pie chart showing $97B TAM
- Regulatory timeline (2024-2030)
- Market size stats with icons
- Highlight "Government-Mandated" in bold

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is NOT a 'nice to have.' This is mandatory healthcare transformation. CMS is FORCING this change. The money is HERE, the demand is HERE, and the regulations REQUIRE our solution. We're not selling—we're fulfilling federal mandates."

---

# Slide 5: Business Model - Multiple Revenue Streams = De-Risked

## Four Independent Paths to $10M+ ARR Each

### Stream 1: CCM/RPM Billing Automation
**Value Prop:** "We find $100K/year in lost revenue for your practice"

- **How it works:** WellFit auto-tracks nurse time, generates SOAP notes, submits claims
- **Customer:** Primary care practices, geriatricians
- **Pricing:** 30% of collected CCM revenue
- **Revenue:** $900-$1,800/month per 50-patient practice
- **At scale (1,000 practices):** $10M-$21M ARR

**Why customers pay:**
- Found money (90% wasn't being billed before)
- Saves nurses 8+ hours/week
- CAC payback: 3-6 months

---

### Stream 2: Hospital Readmission Prevention
**Value Prop:** "We prevent $500K-$2M/year in readmissions for your hospital"

- **How it works:** AI identifies high-risk seniors, nurse intervenes before crisis
- **Customer:** Hospitals in MSSP programs
- **Pricing:** $500-$1,500 per prevented readmission (pay-for-performance)
- **Alternative:** $25-$50/patient/year (SaaS)
- **Expected outcome:** 15-25% reduction in 30-day readmissions
- **At scale (50 hospitals):** $5M-$15M ARR

**Why customers pay:**
- Hospital saves $50K per prevented readmission
- ROI = 10x-50x
- No integration hassle (FHIR = plug & play)

---

### Stream 3: Medicare Advantage Plans (PMPM)
**Value Prop:** "We increase your CMS Star rating = $100M+ in bonuses"

- **How it works:** Seniors self-report SDOH daily → Syncs to plan's EHR via FHIR
- **Customer:** Medicare Advantage plans
- **Pricing:** $10-$15/patient/month ($120-$180/year)
- **Alternative:** Revenue share (15-25% of CMS quality bonus increase)
- **Impact:** 0.5-1.0 Star rating improvement = $100M-$300M MORE from CMS
- **At scale (3-5 plans, 500K members):** $30M-$90M ARR

**Why customers pay:**
- 90%+ SDOH completion rate (best in industry)
- Switching costs are MASSIVE (multi-sided platform)
- ROI = 20x-50x

---

### Stream 4: AI Clinical Intelligence (SaaS)
**Value Prop:** "AI tells you which 10 patients need intervention TODAY"

- **How it works:** Physician Command Center with AI-powered triage
- **Customer:** Health systems (ACOs, PCMHs)
- **Pricing:** $25-$75/patient/year
- **At scale (100K patients):** $2.5M-$7.5M ARR

**Why customers pay:**
- Proprietary data (patient SDOH + outcomes)
- Embedded in workflow
- Better than Epic's basic alerts

---

**Slide Visual:**
- Four quadrants with revenue stream details
- Arrows showing "Year 1 → Year 5" revenue growth
- Customer logos (if available) or industry icons
- Emphasize "4 independent paths" for de-risking

**Speaker Notes:**
"If hospital sales are slow, CCM billing still works. If MA plans take time, hospital contracts still work. We have FOUR independent revenue streams. Each one is a $10M+ ARR opportunity. This de-risks the investment and gives us multiple paths to scale."

### Our Multi-Layered Moat

**1. Data Moat (Proprietary SDOH Dataset)**
- 70%+ SDOH completion rate (vs 10-20% industry)
- AI models trained on this data = better predictions
- **Time to replicate:** 18-24 months + 100K patients

**2. Technical Moat (FHIR Integration)**
- Bidirectional FHIR R4 with 10 resources
- Works with ALL EHRs out of the box
- **Competitors need $2M-$5M investment to match**

**3. UX Moat (Senior Engagement)**
- 70%+ daily active usage (vs 5% for patient portals)
- Senior-specific design (large fonts, gamification)
- **Hard to replicate—most apps fail at senior engagement**

**4. Workflow Moat (Embedded in Provider Workflow)**
- NurseOS, Physician Command Center = providers live here all day
- Not a "nice to have" tool—it's their operating system
- **Switching costs are enormous**

**5. Multi-Sided Network Effects**
- More seniors → More data → Better AI → More hospitals buy → More referrals → More seniors (flywheel)

**6. Regulatory Moat (Federal Mandate)**
- 21st Century Cures Act REQUIRES FHIR (Epic can't block us)
- CMS REQUIRES SDOH data collection
- **We're riding mandatory transformation—not optional adoption**

**Slide Visual:**
- Comparison table (make WellFit column highlighted/bold)
- Moat diagram (concentric circles showing layers of defensibility)
- Timeline: "Time to Replicate: 24-36 months + $5M-$10M"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Epic tried patient engagement with MyChart. 5% usage. Seniors hate it. Livongo does condition-specific engagement but no EHR integration. CarePort does care coordination but no patient app. We're the ONLY platform with full-stack: patient, provider, EHR, billing. Time to replicate: 2-3 years minimum."

# Slide 7: Product Demo - How It Works

## The Complete Patient Journey (90 Seconds)

### Act 1: Senior (Margaret, 72, CHF + Diabetes)
**Morning - 8:00 AM**
- Opens WellFit app on tablet
- Daily check-in: "How are you feeling today?"
  - Mood: "A bit tired"
  - Energy: 6/10
  - Did you take your medications? "Yes"
  - Vitals: Weight up 3 lbs (red flag - fluid retention)
  - SDOH: "Did you eat 3 meals yesterday?" → "No, ran out of groceries"

**AI Risk Assessment:**
- Weight gain + fatigue + food insecurity = **HIGH RISK** for CHF exacerbation
- Alert sent to care team

---

### Act 2: Nurse (Sarah, CCM Coordinator)
**Mid-Morning - 10:30 AM**
- Logs into NurseOS Clarity dashboard
- **AI Alert:** "Margaret Thompson - HIGH RISK - Intervene Today"
- Reviews AI summary:
  - "Weight up 3 lbs, reports fatigue, food insecurity"
  - "Last hospitalization: 45 days ago (CHF)"
  - "Recommended action: Call patient, assess fluid overload, arrange meal delivery"

**Sarah calls Margaret:**
- Confirms symptoms
- Advises to reduce salt intake
- Connects Margaret to Meals on Wheels
- Schedules telehealth visit with doctor tomorrow

**SmartScribe auto-generates SOAP note:**
- "Patient reports weight gain 3 lbs, fatigue, food insecurity. Advised dietary modifications, arranged social services referral. Telehealth scheduled 10/19."
- **Billing codes auto-suggested:** CPT 99490 (CCM, 20 min), ICD-10 I50.9 (CHF), Z59.4 (food insecurity)

**Result:** Crisis averted. Hospitalization prevented. CCM time auto-tracked.

---

### Act 3: Doctor (Dr. Chen, Primary Care)
**Afternoon - 2:00 PM**
- Opens Physician Command Center
- Sees Margaret flagged in "Top 10 Patients Today"
- Reviews AI-generated summary + nurse notes
- Conducts 10-min telehealth visit
- Orders:
  - Increase Lasix (diuretic) to 40mg
  - Daily weight monitoring
  - Follow-up in 3 days

**SmartScribe captures conversation:**
- Auto-generates progress note
- Suggests billing code: 99214 (telehealth, moderate complexity)
- Pushes care plan to Margaret's EHR (Epic) via FHIR

---

### Act 4: EHR Sync (Automated)
- Margaret's Epic EHR receives:
  - Updated weight (FHIR Observation)
  - Food insecurity flag (FHIR Condition, Z59.4)
  - Care plan update (FHIR CarePlan)
  - Lasix prescription (FHIR MedicationRequest)
- Hospital's quality dashboard updates:
  - SDOH data captured ✓
  - High-risk patient intervention ✓
  - Readmission prevented ✓

---

### Outcome (30 Days Later)
- Margaret's CHF stable (no hospitalization)
- **Hospital saved:** $50,000 (prevented readmission)
- **Practice billed:** $240 CCM revenue (WellFit captured it automatically)
- **MA plan earned:** $500 CMS quality bonus (SDOH data submitted)
- **Nurse Sarah:** Saved 30 minutes (SmartScribe auto-documentation)
- **Margaret:** Feels supported, avoids hospital, gets meals delivered

**Slide Visual:**
- Timeline graphic (left to right): Senior → Nurse → Doctor → EHR
- Screenshots of each interface (app, dashboard, command center)
- Outcome metrics callout box
- Optional: QR code linking to 2-minute demo video

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is how WellFit works in practice. Margaret's morning check-in triggers AI alert. Sarah the nurse intervenes in minutes. Dr. Chen reviews and prescribes in a 10-minute telehealth visit. The entire care plan syncs back to Epic automatically. Hospitalization prevented. $50K saved. CCM billing captured. SDOH data submitted. All in one day. This is the power of the full stack."

**Slide Visual:**
- 5-year ARR growth chart (hockey stick curve)
- Revenue stream pie chart (Year 5 breakdown)
- Use of funds pie chart
- LTV:CAC trend line (showing improvement over time)

**Speaker Notes:**
"We're projecting $65M ARR by Year 5 with 75% gross margins. This is a software business with four independent revenue streams—if one is slow, the others compensate. We're asking for $2M-$5M to reach $2.5M ARR in 18 months. That gives us the traction to raise a $15M-$25M Series A at a $30M-$50M valuation. The path to $100M ARR is clear."

### The One-Paragraph Pitch

*"WellFit is the operating system for value-based senior care. We're the ONLY platform that combines patient engagement—seniors self-report social determinants of health daily at 70% engagement—with AI-powered clinical intelligence, bidirectional EHR integration via FHIR, and automated billing capture. Hospitals prevent $50K readmissions. Practices generate $100K/year in found CCM billing. Medicare Advantage plans improve Star ratings worth $100M+. We're in production with 125 components, 118 database migrations, and working FHIR integration with Epic and Cerner. Market is $97B and government-mandated. We're raising $2M-$5M seed to scale from pilot to 25,000 patients and land 10 hospital contracts. Exit via acquisition to Epic/UnitedHealth at $500M-$1.5B in Year 5, or IPO at $1.5B-$3B in Year 7. This is the full stack. This is how you save lives AND build a billion-dollar company."*
