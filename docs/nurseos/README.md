## üéØ What This Is

A **comprehensive burnout prevention platform** for community and hospital nurses, consisting of:

**NurseOS Clarity‚Ñ¢** - For community/outpatient nurses (CCM, telehealth, home health)

## üöß What's Next (Code Implementation)

### Step 1: Create TypeScript Types (30 min)
**File:** `src/types/nurseos.ts`
**Action:** Copy types from [typescript-types-spec.md](./typescript-types-spec.md)
**Test:** `npm run typecheck` (should pass)

### Step 2: Create Service Layer (4-6 hours)
**File:** `src/services/resilienceHubService.ts`
**Action:** Implement core functions:
- `submitDailyCheckin()` - Save daily emotional check-in
- `hasCheckedInToday()` - Check if user checked in today
- `getMyCheckins()` - Get user's recent check-ins
- `submitBurnoutAssessment()` - Save MBI assessment
- `getLatestBurnoutRisk()` - Get current risk level
- `getActiveModules()` - Get training modules
- `getResources()` - Get self-care resources

**Reference:** [QUICK_START_GUIDE.md](./QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) - Day 3-4

### Step 3: Create UI Components (8-12 hours)
**Files:**
- `src/components/nurseos/DailyCheckinForm.tsx` - 5-slider check-in form
- `src/components/nurseos/ResilienceHubDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard with risk badge

**Reference:** [QUICK_START_GUIDE.md](./QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) - Day 5-7

### Step 4: Integrate with NursePanel (1 hour)
**File:** `src/components/nurse/NursePanel.tsx`
**Action:** Add collapsible section "Emotional Resilience Hub üßò"

**Reference:** [QUICK_START_GUIDE.md](./QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) - Day 5-7

### Step 5: Test & Deploy (2-4 hours)
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` - passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` - passes
- [ ] Manual test: Submit check-in, view dashboard
- [ ] RLS test: Verify providers can't see each other's data
- [ ] Deploy to production

**Reference:** [ZERO_TECH_DEBT_CHECKLIST.md](./ZERO_TECH_DEBT_CHECKLIST.md)

## üéØ MVP Scope (3 Screens Only)

**What we're building NOW:**
1. **Resilience Hub Dashboard** - Shows burnout risk + prompt to check in
2. **Daily Check-In Form** - 5 sliders (stress, energy, mood, patients, calls)
3. That's it.

**What we're deferring to v1.1:**
- Burnout Assessment Form (MBI) - complex, defer
- Resilience Training Modules UI - just link externally for now
- Peer Support Circles - complex, defer
- Manager Dashboard - admin feature, defer
- Workload Analytics - requires `encounters` table

---

## üìä Database Schema Summary

### Core Tables (Provider Data)
- `provider_burnout_assessments` - MBI scores (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment)
- `provider_daily_checkins` - Daily stress/mood/workload (supports both Clarity & Shield)

### Training & Resources
- `resilience_training_modules` - Evidence-based training content
- `provider_training_completions` - Track who completed what
- `resilience_resources` - Self-care library (988 Lifeline, apps, articles)

### Peer Support
- `provider_support_circles` - Small groups (5-8 members)
- `provider_support_circle_members` - Membership table
- `provider_support_reflections` - Anonymous/named posts

### Configuration
- `nurseos_product_config` - Product selection (Clarity, Shield, or both)
- `nurseos_feature_flags` - Feature toggles (13 flags)

**All tables have:**
- ‚úÖ Foreign keys to `fhir_practitioners` and `auth.users`
- ‚úÖ Indexes on FK columns and date columns
- ‚úÖ RLS policies (providers see own data, admins see all)
- ‚úÖ Created/updated timestamps

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Database Deployment
‚úÖ **Migration is already deployed** to remote database
‚ùå **DO NOT re-run the migration** unless you're resetting the database

### Workload Analytics
‚ö†Ô∏è **Workload analytics is disabled** because `encounters` table doesn't exist
- This is intentional and documented
- Can be enabled later when encounters table is created
- See [DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md) for details

### Feature Flags
All feature flags are **disabled by default** (except `daily_checkins` and `burnout_assessments`)
- This is intentional for gradual rollout
- Enable via Supabase SQL editor or admin UI (when built)
