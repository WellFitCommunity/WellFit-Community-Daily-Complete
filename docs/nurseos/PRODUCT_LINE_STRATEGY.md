# NurseOS Dual Product Line Strategy

## Executive Summary

WellFit's NurseOS platform will launch as **two complementary but standalone products**, each optimized for different nursing environments:

1. **NurseOS Clarity™** - Community/outpatient nurse burnout prevention
2. **NurseOS Shield™** - Hospital/acute care nurse burnout prevention

Both share a **common technical foundation** (modular monolith) but have **distinct UIs, workflows, and go-to-market strategies**.

## Shared Technical Foundation

Both products share the **same codebase** (modular monolith) but with **feature flags** and **role-based UI** to create distinct experiences.

### Shared Components
- ✅ `fhir_practitioners` table (practitioner resource)
- ✅ `provider_burnout_assessments` table (MBI scoring)
- ✅ `resilience_training_modules` table (content library)
- ✅ `provider_support_circles` table (peer support)
- ✅ Core service layer (`resilienceHubService.ts`)

### Product-Specific Customizations

#### Database (Product Differentiation via Data)

**Clarity-Specific Fields (Community):**
```sql
-- In provider_daily_checkins:
work_setting = 'remote', 'office', 'home_visits', 'telehealth'
patients_contacted_today INTEGER
difficult_patient_calls INTEGER
prior_auth_denials INTEGER
missed_break BOOLEAN
after_hours_work BOOLEAN
```

**Shield-Specific Fields (Hospital):**
```sql
-- In provider_daily_checkins:
work_setting = 'hospital_shift'
shift_type TEXT  -- 'day', 'night', 'swing'
patient_acuity_score DECIMAL  -- Sum of patient acuity levels
codes_responded_to INTEGER  -- # of rapid responses, code blues
lateral_violence_incident BOOLEAN  -- Experienced bullying, yelling
unsafe_staffing BOOLEAN  -- Nurse:patient ratio exceeded safe limits
```

#### UI (Product Differentiation via Theme)

**Clarity Theme:**
- Colors: Teal (#14B8A6), Coral (#FB923C), Soft Gray (#F3F4F6)
- Typography: Rounded sans-serif (Inter, Nunito)
- Tone: Warm, gentle, nurturing
- Icons: Soft, rounded (Heroicons Outline)

**Shield Theme:**
- Colors: Navy (#1E3A8A), Orange (#FB923C), Charcoal (#374151)
- Typography: Strong sans-serif (Inter, Roboto)
- Tone: Empowering, protective, resilient
- Icons: Bold, sharp (Heroicons Solid)

#### Feature Flags (Product Selection)

```sql
-- New table: product_config
CREATE TABLE product_config (
  organization_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  product_line TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'clarity' or 'shield' or 'both'
  branding JSONB,  -- Custom logo, colors for white-label
  enabled_features TEXT[]  -- ['daily_checkins', 'brain_generator', 'medication_guardian']
);
```

**Frontend Logic:**
```typescript
const product = await getOrganizationProduct(organizationId);

if (product === 'clarity') {
  // Show community-focused UI
  // Hide Brain Generator, Medication Guardian
  // Show workload rebalancing, compassion fatigue tracker
}

if (product === 'shield') {
  // Show hospital-focused UI
  // Show Brain Generator, Medication Guardian
  // Hide CCM workload analytics
}

if (product === 'both') {
  // Full feature set (rare, but possible for hybrid orgs)
}
```

## Deployment Architecture

### Option A: Single Deployment with Product Toggle (Recommended for MVP)

```
nurseos.wellfit.com
├── Login
├── Product Detection (based on organization_id)
│   ├── If Clarity → Redirect to /clarity/dashboard
│   └── If Shield → Redirect to /shield/dashboard
│
├── /clarity/ (Community UI)
│   ├── Dashboard (compassion fatigue focus)
│   ├── Check-In (remote work fields)
│   └── Peer Circles (async)
│
└── /shield/ (Hospital UI)
    ├── Dashboard (shift stress focus)
    ├── Check-In (acuity + codes)
    └── Rapid Support (real-time chat)
```

**Pros:**
- Single codebase, single deployment
- Shared database (zero duplication)
- Faster iteration

**Cons:**
- Larger bundle size (users download both UIs, even if they only use one)

---

### Option B: Separate Subdomains (Phase 2)

```
clarity.nurseos.com  (Community Product)
├── Shared: Auth, FHIR resources, backend API
└── UI: Optimized for community nurses

shield.nurseos.com  (Hospital Product)
├── Shared: Auth, FHIR resources, backend API
└── UI: Optimized for hospital nurses
```

**Pros:**
- Smaller bundle per product (faster load times)
- Distinct branding/URLs for marketing
- Clearer product positioning

**Cons:**
- 2 deployments to manage
- Shared backend still couples products

---

### Option C: Full Microservices (Phase 3 - Future)

```
Clarity Service (clarity.nurseos.com)
├── Own React app
├── Own database tables (clarity_* prefix)
└── Shares: Auth, FHIR Practitioner (API calls)

Shield Service (shield.nurseos.com)
├── Own React app
├── Own database tables (shield_* prefix)
└── Shares: Auth, FHIR Practitioner (API calls)

Core Service (api.nurseos.com)
├── FHIR Practitioner management
├── Authentication
└── Billing/subscription management
```

**When to extract:**
- When each product has $1M+ ARR
- When products have 10,000+ users each
- When development teams are separate (dedicated engineers per product)

## Financial Projections

### Clarity (Community)
**Year 1:**
- 500 nurses × $18/mo = $9,000/mo = $108K ARR
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $500/nurse
- LTV (Lifetime Value): $18/mo × 24 months = $432
- LTV:CAC ratio = 0.86 (needs improvement)

**Year 2:**
- 2,000 nurses × $18/mo = $36K/mo = $432K ARR
- CAC decreases to $200/nurse (channel partnerships)
- LTV:CAC ratio = 2.16 (healthy)

- 1,000 nurses × $28/mo = $28K/mo = $336K ARR
- CAC: $1,500/nurse (enterprise sales)
- LTV: $28/mo × 36 months = $1,008
- LTV:CAC ratio = 0.67 (typical for enterprise)

**Year 3:**
- 10,000 nurses × $28/mo = $280K/mo = $3.36M ARR
- CAC decreases to $800/nurse (brand awareness)
- LTV:CAC ratio = 1.26 (improving)

---

## Decision: Build Both? Or Start with One?

### Recommendation: **Start with Clarity, then Shield**

**Rationale:**
1. **Faster GTM:** Clarity leverages existing WellFit CCM infrastructure (80% code reuse)
2. **Lower risk:** Community market is less regulated (no hospital EHR integration)
3. **Validate concept:** Prove burnout prevention works before tackling hospitals
4. **Fundraising story:** $500K ARR from Clarity validates market, then raise Series A for Shield expansion

**Timeline:**
- **Months 1-3:** Build + launch Clarity MVP
- **Months 4-6:** Iterate Clarity based on feedback, reach $100K ARR
- **Months 7-9:** Start Shield development (using Clarity codebase as foundation)
- **Months 10-12:** Launch Shield pilot with 1-2 hospitals
- **Year 2:** Scale both products in parallel
