**What it is:**
- Protected clinical decision-making workspace for physicians
- Where providers chart patient care safely

## Panel Naming Philosophy

All panels follow the **navigation and safety** metaphor:

| Panel | Role | Metaphor | Primary Function |
|-------|------|----------|------------------|
| **Safe Harbor** | Physician | Protected anchorage | Clinical decision-making zone |
| **Lighthouse** | Nurse | Warning beacon | Patient monitoring & safety |
| **Mission Control** | Admin | Command center | System oversight & operations |
| **Bridge** | EHR Integration | Connector | Link external systems to platform |

**The Complete Journey:**
1. **Bridge** connects external EHR to Envision
2. **Gateway** imports data securely (one-way)
3. **Safe Harbor** (physicians) makes clinical decisions using that data
4. **Lighthouse** (nurses) monitors patients vigilantly
5. **Mission Control** (admins) oversees all operations
6. **Compass Riley** guides documentation throughout
7. **Atlas** maps revenue opportunities
8. **Beacon** warns of clinical risks
