// Get current active care plan
const current = await FHIRService.CarePlan.getCurrent(patientId);

// Get all active plans
const active = await FHIRService.CarePlan.getActive(patientId);

// Get activity summary
const summary = await FHIRService.CarePlan.getActivitiesSummary(carePlanId);

// Create new care plan
const newPlan = await FHIRService.CarePlan.create({
  patient_id: patientId,
  status: 'active',
  intent: 'plan',
  category: ['assess-plan'],
  title: 'Diabetes Management Plan',
  description: 'Comprehensive plan for managing Type 2 Diabetes',
  period_start: new Date().toISOString(),
  goal_displays: ['Maintain HbA1c below 7%', 'Reduce weight by 10 pounds'],
  addresses_condition_displays: ['Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus'],
  activities: [
    {
