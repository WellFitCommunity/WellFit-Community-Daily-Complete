**Status:** Draft
**Date:** January 2026
**Context:** Response to Anthropic's opt-in request for code training contribution

## Email Draft

**Subject:** Re: Code Training Opt-In — Partnership Opportunity

Hi [Anthropic Contact],

Thank you for reaching out about contributing to Claude's training. I'm genuinely interested, but I'd like to propose something more strategic than a simple opt-in.

**Our Codebase:**
WellFit Community / Envision Atlus is a production HIPAA-compliant healthcare platform with:
- 40+ Claude-powered AI services (care coordination, clinical documentation, risk prediction)
- Multi-tenant white-label architecture serving healthcare organizations
- Full SOC 2 compliance patterns with PHI protection
- 5,600+ tests, zero `any` types, enterprise-grade TypeScript

This isn't a weekend project — it's a real healthcare SaaS built ground-up with Claude Code over the past year.

**What I'm Proposing:**
Rather than a standard opt-in, I'd welcome a conversation about WellFit becoming a **reference implementation** for HIPAA-compliant Claude applications. In exchange for access to our patterns, I'm interested in:

- A case study or "Built with Claude" feature highlighting our healthcare AI work
- Introductions to healthcare organizations evaluating Claude for clinical workflows
- Early access to healthcare-relevant Claude features or fine-tuning capabilities
- Potential speaking opportunity to share lessons learned

I have patent-pending IP in this codebase, so I'd need to understand what's included/excluded and ensure appropriate protections.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this? I'm flexible on timing.

Best,
[Your Name]
