## 💸 Revenue Model - Multiple Moats, Multiple Streams

### **Stream 1: CCM/RPM Billing Automation ($18K-$432K/year per practice)**

**The Pain Point:**
- Medicare PAYS practices $60-$120/patient/month for chronic care management
- BUT most practices don't bill it (90%+ leakage) because:
  - Documentation takes 2-3 hours/patient/month (nurses hate it)
  - Compliance requirements are complex (CMS audits are scary)
  - Time tracking is manual (nurses forget to log)

**How WellFit Solves It:**
1. **Patient self-reports daily** (vitals, symptoms, SDOH) → Counts toward "engagement" requirement
2. **CCM Autopilot** auto-tracks nurse time (phone calls, care coordination, reviews)
3. **SmartScribe** generates SOAP notes + care plans in 2 minutes (not 30 minutes)
4. **Compliance validation** checks all CMS boxes before billing
5. **One-click claim submission** (837P X12 file generated automatically)

**Revenue:**
- WellFit fee: **30% of collected CCM revenue**
- Typical practice (50 CCM patients): $3,000-$6,000/month collections → **$900-$1,800/month to WellFit**
- **$10,800-$21,600/year per practice**
- **At scale (1,000 practices): $10M-$21M ARR**

**Why this is defensible:**
- You need patient engagement app + EHR integration + billing automation (nobody else has all 3)
- Nurses love it (saves 8+ hours/week)
- Providers love it (found money - 90% wasn't being billed before)
- **CAC payback: 3-6 months** (super fast)

---

### **Stream 2: Hospital Readmission Prevention ($50K-$500K/year per hospital)**

**The Pain Point:**
- Hospitals lose $50,000 per readmitted patient (CMS penalty)
- 30-day readmission rate: 15-20% for seniors (Medicare tracks this)
- Hospitals in MSSP programs (Medicare Shared Savings) get PUNISHED for readmissions

**How WellFit Solves It:**
1. **High-risk seniors identified** (AI analyzes EHR + self-reported SDOH + prior admissions)
2. **Post-discharge tracking** (patients check in daily → early warning if declining)
3. **Nurse intervention triggers** (before crisis → phone call/visit prevents ER)
4. **Medication reconciliation** (90% of readmissions due to med errors)
5. **SDOH barriers addressed** (food insecurity, no transportation → social services referral)

**Outcome:**
- **15-25% reduction in 30-day readmissions** (published data from similar programs)
- **Hospital saves $500K-$2M/year** (100 prevented readmissions × $50K each)

**Revenue Model Options:**

**Option A: Pay-for-Performance**
- Hospital pays **$500-$1,500 per prevented readmission**
- WellFit tracks patients for 30 days post-discharge
- Only get paid if readmission prevented (verified via claims data)
- **Revenue: $50K-$150K/year per 100 high-risk discharges**

**Option B: SaaS Subscription**
- Hospital pays **$25-$50/patient/year** for ALL discharged seniors
- Flat fee, predictable revenue
- **Revenue: $50K-$100K/year per 2,000 patients**

**Option C: Hybrid (Best Model)**
- Low base SaaS fee ($15/patient/year) + performance bonus ($500/prevented readmission)
- De-risks for hospital, upside for WellFit
- **Revenue: $100K-$300K/year per hospital** (depending on volume)

**At scale (50 hospitals): $5M-$15M ARR**

**Why this is defensible:**
- FHIR integration (Epic/Cerner access) = 18-24 month build
- AI risk model (requires data) = proprietary
- Patient engagement (70% daily usage) = nobody else achieves this
- **Hospitals can't easily switch once you're preventing readmissions**

---

### **Stream 3: Medicare Advantage Plans ($1M-$50M/year per plan)**

**The Pain Point:**
- MA plans get PAID MORE by CMS for higher "Star Ratings" (quality scores)
- **1-star improvement = $1,000-$3,000 MORE per patient/year from CMS**
- Stars depend on SDOH data collection + care gap closure (mammograms, A1C tests, etc.)
- MA plans have NO WAY to collect SDOH data (patients don't report it, EHRs don't capture it)

**How WellFit Solves It:**
1. **Seniors self-report SDOH daily** (food, housing, transportation, loneliness)
2. **Gamified engagement** (trivia, community moments) → 70%+ completion rate (vs. 10-20% for surveys)
3. **Auto-syncs to plan's EHR via FHIR** → Counts toward CMS quality metrics
4. **Care gap reminders** (patient gets push notification: "You're due for flu shot")
5. **Quality measure tracking** (HEDIS measures auto-calculated)

**Outcome:**
- **90%+ SDOH completion rate** (best in industry - typical surveys get 20%)
- **0.5-1.0 Star rating improvement** (measurable within 12 months)
- **MA plan earns $100M-$300M MORE from CMS** (for 100K members × $1,000-$3,000 each)

**Revenue Model:**

**Option A: Per-Member-Per-Month (PMPM)**
- Plan pays **$10-$15/patient/month** ($120-$180/patient/year)
- **Revenue: $12M-$18M/year for 100K members**

**Option B: Revenue Share**
- WellFit gets **15-25% of CMS quality bonus increase**
- Higher upside, higher risk
- **Revenue: $15M-$75M/year for 100K members** (if plan gets $1,000-$3,000/patient bonus)

**At scale (3-5 MA plans, 500K members): $30M-$90M ARR**

**Why this is defensible:**
- SDOH engagement at 70%+ rate (nobody else achieves this with seniors)
- FHIR bidirectional sync (must push data back to plan's EHR)
- Multi-sided platform (patient + provider + plan all using WellFit)
- **Switching costs are MASSIVE** (re-enrollment, re-training, data migration)

---

### **Stream 4: AI Clinical Intelligence (SaaS to Health Systems)**

**The Pain Point:**
- Primary care doctors manage 2,000+ patients
- Can't identify high-risk patients until they're in crisis
- No time to review EHR alerts (100+ per day, 90% false positives)

**How WellFit Solves It:**
- **Physician Command Center** (AI-powered patient triage dashboard)
- **Risk scores calculated daily** (combines EHR + patient self-reports + claims data)
- **Prioritized patient list** (top 10 patients who need intervention TODAY)
- **AI-generated action items** (call patient re: medication adherence, order A1C test, etc.)

**Revenue:**
- **$25-$75/patient/year** SaaS subscription (health system-wide)
- **At scale (100K patients): $2.5M-$7.5M ARR**

**Why this is defensible:**
- AI model trained on YOUR unique dataset (patient self-reports + outcomes)
- Multi-modal data (EHR + SDOH + behavioral) = better predictions than Epic's basic alerts
- Embedded in workflow (not a separate tool - inside Physician Command Center)

## 🛡️ Competitive Moat - Why You Win

### **The Moat Is Multi-Layered**

1. **Data Moat (Proprietary SDOH + Outcomes Dataset)**
   - You capture SDOH data nobody else has (70%+ completion rate vs. 10-20% industry standard)
   - AI models trained on this data = better predictions than competitors
   - **Time to replicate: 18-24 months + 100K patients**

2. **Technical Moat (FHIR Integration)**
   - Bidirectional FHIR R4 with 10 resources = 18-24 months to build properly
   - Works with ALL EHRs (Epic, Cerner, etc.) out of the box
   - **Competitors need $2M-$5M investment to match**

3. **UX Moat (Senior Engagement)**
   - 70%+ daily active usage (vs. 5% for patient portals)
   - Senior-specific design (large fonts, simple UI, gamification)
   - **Hard to replicate - most apps fail at senior engagement**

4. **Workflow Moat (Embedded in Provider Workflow)**
   - NurseOS, Physician Command Center = providers live in WellFit all day
   - Not a "nice to have" tool - it's their operating system
   - **Switching costs are enormous (re-training, workflow disruption)**

5. **Multi-Sided Network Effects**
   - More seniors → More data → Better AI → More hospitals buy → More referrals → More seniors (flywheel)
   - **First-mover advantage in senior FHIR + SDOH space**

6. **Regulatory Moat (Federal Mandate)**
   - 21st Century Cures Act REQUIRES FHIR APIs (Epic can't block you)
   - CMS REQUIRES SDOH data collection (starting 2025)
   - **You're riding mandatory transformation - not optional adoption**

---

## 🎤 Why Investors Will Fund This

### **1. Massive, Proven Market**
- **Not speculative:** $1T shift to value-based care is happening NOW
- **Government-mandated:** CMS requires SDOH data, FHIR access
- **Budget exists:** Medicare pays $60-$120/patient/month for CCM (automatic reimbursement)

### **2. Multiple Revenue Streams = De-Risked**
- If hospital sales are slow → CCM billing still works
- If MA plans take time → hospital contracts still work
- **You have 4 independent paths to $10M ARR**

### **3. Strong Unit Economics**
- **CAC:** $200-$500 (patient-directed), $1,500 (hospital B2B)
- **LTV:** $1,500-$8,000 (3-5 year retention)
- **LTV:CAC = 3x-80x** (depending on scale)
- **Gross margin: 70-75%** (software + light services)

### **4. Traction Before You Raise**
