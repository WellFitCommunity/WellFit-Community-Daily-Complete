## Demo Script (For Your Pitches)

### Opening (2 min)
"I'm going to show you how WellFit solves the three biggest problems rural hospitals face: staff shortages, compliance burden, and revenue leakage."

### Live Demo (10 min)

**1. Nurse Dashboard** (3 min)
- Show mobile view on phone
- Document a patient observation
- Create shift handoff
- Show critical patient alerts

**2. Physician Dashboard** (3 min)
- Review handoff from nurse
- Use AI scribe for note
- Order medication (drug interaction alert)
- Schedule telehealth visit

**3. Admin Panel** (4 min)
- Enroll new senior
- Show CCM time tracking
- Show security audit log
- Show compliance dashboard

## Objection Handling

### "We already have an EHR"
**Response**: "Perfect! We integrate via FHIR. Think of us as your care coordination layer on top of your EHR. We handle CCM, handoffs, and patient engagement - things your EHR wasn't designed for."

### "Too expensive for a rural hospital"
**Response**: "Let me show you the ROI. If we help you capture just 10 more CCM patients per month at $65/patient, that's $7,800/year. Our system pays for itself in month one."

### "Our staff won't adopt new technology"
**Response**: "That's why we built it mobile-first. Your nurses already use their phones constantly. We're just giving them a better tool. Training is 2 hours, not 2 weeks."

### "Security concerns with cloud"
**Response**: "I hear you. Let me show you our SOC2 audit report. We have the same security controls as Epic and Cerner, but at 1/10th the cost. Your data is encrypted, backed up daily, and we have full audit trails."
