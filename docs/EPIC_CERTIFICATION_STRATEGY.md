```markdown
## WellFit Community Health Worker Platform

### Overview
WellFit Community is a patient engagement and community health worker (CHW)
coordination platform designed to COMPLEMENT Epic EHR systems. We help
healthcare organizations extend care beyond the clinic by empowering CHW teams
to support patients with social determinants of health, chronic disease
management, and post-discharge care coordination.

### How We Integrate with Epic
WellFit Community connects to Epic via FHIR APIs to:
1. Read patient demographics and care plans
2. Retrieve observation data (vitals, labs) for CHW review
3. Access medication lists to support adherence coaching
4. Pull condition/diagnosis information for targeted interventions
5. Sync care team information for coordinated support

### Use Cases
- **Post-Discharge Support**: CHWs follow up with patients after hospital
  discharge to ensure medication adherence and prevent readmissions
- **SDOH Screening**: Community workers assess housing, food security,
  transportation needs
- **Chronic Disease Management**: Support patients with diabetes, hypertension,
  COPD between clinic visits
- **Medication Adherence**: CHWs help patients understand and follow medication
  regimens
- **Care Coordination**: Bridge clinical care (in Epic) with community resources

### Data Flow
Epic EHR ‚Üí (FHIR API) ‚Üí WellFit Community ‚Üí CHW Mobile App ‚Üí Community Health Worker

We READ data from Epic to inform CHW interventions. We do NOT write clinical
documentation back to Epic. Any clinical findings are documented by licensed
providers in Epic.

### Target Users
- Community Health Workers (CHWs)
- Care Coordinators
- Population Health Teams
- Social Workers
- Patients (via mobile app for self-management)

### Compliance
- HIPAA compliant
- SOC 2 Type II certified (in progress)
- PHI encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging of all data access
```

---

### STEP 4: Request FHIR Scopes (Week 1-2)

**IMPORTANT: Only request what you NEED. Epic reviews each scope carefully.**

**Select These Scopes:**

#### Patient-Level (User-Facing/Patient Consent Required)
```
patient/Patient.read           # Patient demographics
patient/Observation.read       # Vitals, labs (for CHW review)
patient/Condition.read         # Diagnoses (for care planning)
patient/MedicationRequest.read # Current medications
patient/AllergyIntolerance.read # Allergies (safety)
patient/CarePlan.read          # Care plans
patient/CareTeam.read          # Care team members
patient/Goal.read              # Patient goals
```

#### System-Level (Backend Service/Pre-authorized)
```
system/Patient.read            # Batch patient lookups
system/Observation.read        # Population health reporting
system/Condition.read          # Disease registry
system/MedicationRequest.read  # Medication adherence tracking
```

**Justification for Each Scope (Epic WILL Ask):**

**Patient.read:**
```
Required to identify patients, display demographics to CHWs, and link Epic
patients to WellFit Community user accounts.
```

**Observation.read:**
```
CHWs need to see recent vitals (BP, glucose, weight) to assess patient status
during home visits and phone check-ins. Helps identify concerning trends.
```

**Condition.read:**
```
CHWs must know patient diagnoses (diabetes, CHF, COPD) to provide appropriate
support and education. Essential for care planning.
```

**MedicationRequest.read:**
```
Critical for medication adherence support. CHWs help patients understand
medication regimens, identify barriers to adherence, and coordinate with
pharmacies.
```

**AllergyIntolerance.read:**
```
Safety requirement. CHWs conducting home visits must be aware of allergies
(medications, foods, environmental) to provide safe care coordination.
```

**CarePlan.read:**
```
CHWs align their support activities with physician-created care plans in Epic.
Ensures coordinated, patient-centered care.
```

**CareTeam.read:**
```
CHWs need to know who else is involved in patient care (PCP, specialists,
case managers) for effective care coordination.
```

**Goal.read:**
```
Patient goals (weight loss, A1C reduction, smoking cessation) guide CHW
interventions and accountability conversations.
```

### STEP 7: Answer Epic's Security Questionnaire (Week 3)

Epic will send a security questionnaire. Key questions:

**Q: Where is patient data stored?**
```
A: Patient data is stored in Supabase PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS
(US-East-1). Data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
Backups are encrypted and retained for 30 days.
```

**Q: How do you handle Epic FHIR credentials?**
```
A: Client secrets are stored in Supabase Vault (encrypted key management).
Access tokens are encrypted in database and rotated every 60 minutes.
Refresh tokens are encrypted and rotated per Epic expiration policy.
```

**Q: Who has access to Epic data?**
```
A: Access is role-based:
- Community Health Workers: Read-only access to assigned patients
- Care Coordinators: Read-only access to care team patients
- Administrators: Configuration only, no patient data access
- Developers: No production data access (use de-identified sandbox only)

All access is logged with user ID, timestamp, patient ID, and data accessed.
```

**Q: Do you write data back to Epic?**
```
A: No. WellFit Community is read-only. CHW observations and interventions
are documented in WellFit. Clinical documentation remains in Epic,
entered by licensed providers.
```

**Q: How do you ensure HIPAA compliance?**
```
A:
- Business Associate Agreement with Epic
- Employee HIPAA training (annual)
- Minimum necessary access principle
- Encrypted data storage and transmission
- Audit logging of all PHI access
- Annual security risk assessments
- Incident response plan with 60-day breach notification
```

**Q: What happens if WellFit Community shuts down?**
```
A: Our BAA includes data return provisions. We will:
1. Provide Epic healthcare organizations with data export (FHIR format)
2. Securely delete all patient data within 30 days
3. Provide certificate of destruction
4. Revoke all API credentials
```

### STEP 8: Submit Application for Review (Week 3)

**Before submitting:**
- [ ] App description clearly positions as COMPLEMENTARY
- [ ] All required documents uploaded
- [ ] Privacy policy published and linked
- [ ] Terms of service published and linked
- [ ] Screenshots show professional, HIPAA-compliant UI
- [ ] Security questionnaire completed
- [ ] Contact information current
- [ ] All redirect URIs tested

**Click:** Submit for Epic Review

**Expected Timeline:**
- Initial review: 1-2 weeks
- Questions/revisions: 1-2 weeks
- Final approval: 1-2 weeks
- **Total: 4-8 weeks**

---

### STEP 9: Respond to Epic Reviewer Feedback (Week 4-6)

Epic reviewers may ask clarifying questions. **Common questions:**

**"How is this different from Epic's MyChart patient portal?"**
```
CORRECT ANSWER:
"WellFit Community is designed for Community Health Workers to coordinate
care between clinic visits, not for direct patient access to medical records.
MyChart is patient-facing for records access and messaging. We complement
MyChart by empowering CHWs to support patients who need extra help navigating
care, addressing SDOH barriers, and adhering to treatment plans. Many patients
using WellFit also use MyChart - they serve different purposes."
```

**"Why do you need system-level scopes?"**
```
CORRECT ANSWER:
"System-level scopes enable our population health features:
1. Identify high-risk patients for CHW outreach (pre-authorized by healthcare org)
2. Generate reports on medication adherence across patient panels
3. Track SDOH interventions at population level
4. Bulk export for analytics (diabetes registry, CHF monitoring)

Patient-level scopes are for individual CHW-patient interactions.
System-level scopes are for organizational care management."
```

**"Do you plan to add clinical documentation features?"**
```
CORRECT ANSWER:
"No. Clinical documentation belongs in Epic. WellFit Community tracks CHW
activities (phone calls, home visits, resource referrals) for care
coordination purposes. Any clinical findings discovered by CHWs are
communicated to providers who document in Epic. We intentionally stay
in our lane as a CHW coordination tool."
```

**"Are you planning an Epic App for in-EHR integration?"**
```
SAFE ANSWER:
"We're focused on standalone integration first via FHIR APIs. In the future,
we'd love to explore Epic App integration to enable EHR launch (e.g., provider
clicks patient chart ‚Üí launches WellFit to assign CHW). This would enhance
Epic's value by making CHW coordination seamless. We'd follow Epic's App
development guidelines and partner with Epic for certification."
```
