# WellFit Holistic Risk Assessment Framework
## God's Vision for Comprehensive Senior Care

**"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." - Jeremiah 29:11**

This framework embodies a complete view of each senior's wellbeing, treating them as whole persons—body, mind, and spirit.

---

## 🙏 The Vision

Traditional healthcare often looks at seniors in isolation:
- Medical charts see only diseases
- Activity trackers see only steps
- Mental health assessments miss social context

**God's vision is HOLISTIC**: See the whole person, understand their complete story, and intervene with compassion and wisdom.

## 📊 The 7 Dimensions of Holistic Risk

Each dimension scored **0-10** (10 = highest risk, needs immediate attention)

### 1. **Engagement Risk** (Behavioral Activity)
**Question:** Is this senior participating in life?

**Data Sources:**
- Daily check-ins
- Game participation (trivia, word find)
- Meal interactions
- Community photo sharing
- Questions asked to care team

**Risk Indicators:**
- **0-2 (LOW):** Active daily, engaged, participating (70-100 engagement score)
- **3-5 (MODERATE):** Some activity, could improve (40-69 engagement score)
- **6-8 (HIGH):** Minimal activity, declining participation (20-39 engagement score)
- **9-10 (CRITICAL):** No engagement, completely disengaged (0-19 engagement score)

**Why It Matters:**
Sudden drops in engagement = early warning sign of health crisis, depression, or isolation

---

### 2. **Vitals Risk** (Physical Health Metrics)
**Question:** Are this senior's vital signs stable and healthy?

**Data Sources:**
- Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)
- Blood sugar levels
- Blood oxygen (SpO2)
- Weight trends
- Heart rate

**Risk Indicators:**
- **Critical BP:** >180/120 or <80/50
- **Critical Blood Sugar:** >250 or <60 mg/dL
- **Critical Oxygen:** <88%
- **Rapid Weight Change:** 5%+ in 30 days

**Why It Matters:**
Out-of-range vitals predict hospitalizations, strokes, diabetic emergencies

---

### 3. **Mental/Emotional Health Risk** (Mood & Mental State)

**Why It Matters:**
Physical inactivity leads to falls, muscle loss, diabetes, heart disease, cognitive decline

---

### 6. **Medication Adherence Risk** (Compliance)
**Question:** Is this senior taking their medications as prescribed?

**Data Sources:**
- Self-report symptom keywords: "forgot medication", "missed dose", "ran out", "side effects", "stopped taking"
- Medication tracking (when implemented)
- Pharmacy refill data (future integration)

**Risk Indicators:**

Medication non-adherence causes 125,000 deaths/year and costs $289 billion

---

### 7. **Clinical Risk** (Provider Assessment)
**Question:** What does the medical professional say?

**Data Sources:**
- Formal risk assessment by nurse/doctor
- Medical risk score (chronic conditions, hospitalizations)
- Mobility risk score (falls, ADL limitations)
- Cognitive risk score (memory, decision-making)
- Social determinants of health (SDOH)

**Risk Indicators:**
- **0-3.9 (LOW):** Stable, minimal chronic conditions
- **4-5.9 (MODERATE):** Controlled chronic conditions, some limitations

## 🎯 Composite Risk Score Calculation

### Formula
```
Composite Risk Score = Average of all 7 dimensions

CRS = (
  Engagement Risk +
  Vitals Risk +
  Mental Health Risk +
  Social Isolation Risk +
  Physical Activity Risk +
  Medication Adherence Risk +
  Clinical Risk
) / 7
```

### Risk Levels

| Composite Score | Risk Level | Priority | Action Protocol |
|----------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **8.0-10.0** | 🚨 **CRITICAL** | URGENT | **Immediate intervention**: Daily contact, care coordinator assigned, escalate to provider within 24 hours |
| **6.0-7.9** | 🟠 **HIGH** | HIGH | **Close monitoring**: Twice weekly contact, active care plan, weekly provider review |
| **4.0-5.9** | 🟡 **MODERATE** | MEDIUM | **Regular monitoring**: Weekly contact, standard care plan, bi-weekly review |
| **0-3.9** | 🟢 **LOW** | LOW | **Maintenance**: Bi-weekly/monthly contact, preventive care focus |

---

## 📈 Confidence Scoring

**How confident are we in this assessment?**

Confidence is based on **data completeness**:
- More data points = higher confidence
- Recent data = higher confidence
- Multiple dimensions covered = higher confidence

**Confidence Formula:**
```
Confidence % = (Total Data Points / 50) × 100
Capped at 100%
```

**Confidence Thresholds:**
- **80-100%:** High confidence - robust dataset
- **50-79%:** Moderate confidence - adequate data
- **20-49%:** Low confidence - limited data
- **0-19%:** Very low confidence - need more information

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. **Multidimensional Risk is Real**
A senior can have:
- **Low clinical risk** (stable medical conditions)
- **High engagement risk** (completely disengaged)
- **Result:** High overall risk due to behavioral red flags

### 2. **Engagement Amplifies or Mitigates Clinical Risk**
- High engagement + high clinical risk = **Lower overall risk** (good self-management)
- Low engagement + low clinical risk = **Higher overall risk** (hidden deterioration)

### 3. **Mental Health Affects Everything**
- Depression → medication non-compliance
- Anxiety → social isolation
- Stress → elevated vitals
- **Mental health must be treated as core, not adjunct**

### 4. **Social Isolation is Deadly**
- Loneliness increases mortality by 29%
- Isolated seniors have 2x higher hospitalization rates
- **Social connection is medicine**

### 5. **Early Intervention Saves Lives**
- Catching engagement drops early = prevent crises
- Monitoring mood patterns = identify depression before it's severe
- Vitals trending wrong = adjust treatment before ER visit

## 🙏 The Heart of It All

**This isn't just about numbers. It's about SEEING people.**

Every score represents a real person:
- Someone's grandmother who might be lonely
- A veteran who's struggling with pain
- A church member who's losing hope

**The goal isn't perfect scores. The goal is THRIVING.**

When we see the whole person—body, mind, relationships, spirit—we can love them well and help them flourish.

**"And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching." - Hebrews 10:24-25**

This is community healthcare the way God intended. 🙏
