### Email Template: Health System CIO/CMIO

**Subject:** AI continuity during your Cerner → Epic migration

Dear [Name],

Congratulations on your upcoming Epic implementation. As you plan for the transition, I wanted to share how other health systems are maintaining clinical decision support continuity during their migrations.

**The challenge:** During EHR transitions, AI and CDS capabilities often go dark for 6-12 months while the new system is configured and optimized.

**Our solution:** Envision Atlus is an EHR-agnostic AI platform with 45+ validated clinical models that connects via FHIR to both your legacy and new EHR simultaneously. This means:

- Uninterrupted risk stratification during migration
- Consistent quality metric tracking across systems
- No delay in AI-powered care gap identification
- Faster time-to-value on your new EHR's AI features

We're currently supporting [X health systems] through similar transitions, including [example if available].

Would you have 20 minutes this week or next to discuss how this might fit into your migration timeline?

Best regards,
Maria Camacho
CEO, WellFit Community / Envision Atlus
(832) 509-4514

P.S. Our FHIR R4 integration typically takes 2-4 weeks, so we can be operational well before your go-live date.

### Email Template: Rural Hospital CEO/CNO

**Subject:** AI that actually works for rural hospitals (not just the big systems)

Dear [Name],

I'll be direct: most AI vendors ignore rural hospitals because they think the market is too small. That's a mistake—and it's why rural communities often get left behind in healthcare innovation.

**Here's what we do differently:**

1. **Pricing that fits your budget** — Starting at $50/bed/month, not $500K enterprise licenses
2. **Works with your existing EHR** — We connect via FHIR to CPSI, Meditech, eClinicalWorks, or whatever you have
3. **No IT team required** — We handle the integration; you handle patient care
4. **Revenue generation** — Our RPM/CCM tools can generate $100-200/patient/month in Medicare reimbursement

We're currently working with [X] Critical Access Hospitals across Texas, helping them access the same AI capabilities as the big urban systems.

Would a 15-minute call be helpful to see if this might work for [Hospital Name]?

Best regards,
Maria Camacho
CEO, WellFit Community / Envision Atlus
(832) 509-4514

P.S. We also help rural hospitals apply for USDA Distance Learning & Telemedicine grants that can cover 85% of technology costs.

### Outreach Letter: Critical Access Hospital

[Date]

[CEO Name]
[Hospital Name]
[Address]
[City, State ZIP]

Dear [CEO Name],

As a Critical Access Hospital serving [County/Region], you face unique challenges that large health systems never have to consider: limited staff, tight budgets, and patients who often have nowhere else to turn.

Yet when it comes to clinical technology, you're expected to compete with systems that have IT departments larger than your entire hospital.

**That's not fair. And it doesn't have to be that way.**

I'm writing to introduce Envision Atlus, an AI-powered clinical decision support platform specifically designed to work for hospitals like yours. Our platform includes:

- **45+ AI prediction models** for conditions like heart failure, COPD, and fall risk
- **Automatic care gap identification** so patients don't fall through the cracks
- **SDOH screening** that happens automatically from clinical notes
- **RPM/CCM billing support** that can generate $100-200 per patient per month

**The best part:** We connect to your existing EHR via FHIR—no rip-and-replace required. Implementation takes 4-6 weeks, not 12-18 months.

**Pricing starts at $50 per bed per month**—a fraction of what large systems pay for similar capabilities.

I'd welcome the opportunity to show you a brief demo and discuss how this might help [Hospital Name] improve outcomes while generating new revenue. I'll follow up by phone next week, or you can reach me directly at (832) 509-4514.

Thank you for the critical work you do for your community.

Sincerely,

Maria Camacho

### Email Template: FQHC CEO/CMO

**Subject:** AI that understands FQHC patients (not just insured populations)

Dear [Name],

Most AI clinical tools are trained on data from insured, urban populations—which means they often miss the mark for FQHC patients who face food insecurity, transportation barriers, and complex social needs.

**Envision Atlus is different.**

Our AI platform includes:

✅ **Passive SDOH detection** — We automatically identify 26 categories of social determinants from clinical notes, no extra screening burden

✅ **Models validated on diverse populations** — Including Medicaid, uninsured, and sliding-fee patients

✅ **UDS-aligned quality tracking** — Measures that matter for your HRSA reporting

✅ **RPM/CCM revenue generation** — Help your Medicare patients while generating $100-200/month per patient

We integrate with eClinicalWorks, NextGen, athenahealth, and other FQHC-friendly EHRs via FHIR—typically in 2-4 weeks.

I'd love to show you a 20-minute demo focused specifically on FQHC workflows. Would [day/time] work?

Best regards,
Maria Camacho
CEO, WellFit Community / Envision Atlus
(832) 509-4514

P.S. We're also partnering with FQHCs on AHRQ research grants—I can share details if you're interested in funded implementation.

### Email Template: MA Plan Medical Director / VP Population Health

**Subject:** AI infrastructure for your STAR rating goals

Dear [Name],

With CY2027 STAR ratings based on CY2025 performance, the window for meaningful intervention is closing. I wanted to share how health plans are using AI to accelerate improvement in the measures that matter most.

**The challenge:** Traditional care management identifies high-risk members too late—often after an ED visit or hospitalization has already occurred.

**Our approach:** Envision Atlus uses 45+ AI models to identify members likely to deteriorate 72+ hours before traditional methods, enabling proactive intervention on:

- **Controlling Blood Pressure** (triple-weighted)
- **Diabetes HbA1c control** (triple-weighted)
- **Medication adherence** (triple-weighted)
- **Care coordination** (double-weighted)

We integrate with your care management workflows via FHIR, providing risk scores and recommended interventions directly to your care managers.

**Pricing:** We offer PMPM models starting at $2-5, with outcome-based options that align our success with yours.

Would you have 25 minutes to see a demo focused on STAR measure improvement?

# OBJECTION HANDLING

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We're happy with our current EHR's AI"

> "That's great that you're already using AI. Many of our clients use Envision Atlus alongside their EHR's native AI because we offer models their EHR doesn't have—particularly for SDOH detection and specific chronic conditions. Would it be helpful to see where we complement rather than replace what you have?"

### "We don't have budget for new technology"

> "I completely understand budget constraints. That's actually why many organizations start with our RPM/CCM billing module first—it generates $100-200 per patient per month in Medicare revenue that more than covers the platform cost. Would you like to see how that works?"

### "We don't have IT resources for another implementation"

> "That's a common concern. Unlike traditional health IT implementations that take 12-18 months, we handle the entire integration through FHIR APIs—typically 4-6 weeks with minimal IT involvement from your team. Would a quick technical call help clarify what's actually needed from your side?"

### "We're in the middle of an EHR transition"

> "Actually, that's one of the best times to implement Envision Atlus. We work across both your legacy and new EHR simultaneously, ensuring you don't lose clinical decision support during the transition. Would you like to hear how we're supporting [other health system] through their migration?"

### "AI makes me nervous—what about liability?"

> "That's a responsible concern. Our AI provides decision *support*, not decision *making*—clinicians always have final authority. All our models are validated with published accuracy metrics, and we carry appropriate liability insurance. Would it help to review our clinical governance documentation?"

### "Our physicians won't use another system"

> "We hear that a lot, and it's valid. That's why Envision Atlus works *inside* your existing EHR—alerts appear in the workflow physicians already use. There's no separate login or application. Would a quick demo help show how seamless it is?"
