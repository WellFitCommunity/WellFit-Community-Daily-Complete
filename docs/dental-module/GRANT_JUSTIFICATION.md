## 1. The Clinical & Business Case

### Why Dental Health Matters for WellFit

**Core Thesis**: **Oral health is not separate from medical health—it is fundamental to chronic disease management, nutrition, and quality of life.**

#### Key Clinical Connections

| Chronic Condition | Oral Health Impact | Bidirectional Relationship |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Diabetes** | 2-3x higher risk of gum disease; poor glucose control worsens periodontal disease | ✓ Treating gum disease improves HbA1c by 0.4-0.7% |
| **Heart Disease** | Periodontal bacteria contribute to arterial inflammation and atherosclerosis | ✓ Gum disease increases heart attack risk by 20-50% |
| **Stroke** | Oral bacteria linked to cerebrovascular events | ✓ Severe gum disease doubles stroke risk |
| **Respiratory Disease** | Oral bacteria aspirated into lungs (pneumonia, COPD exacerbation) | ✓ Poor oral hygiene worsens respiratory infections |
| **Malnutrition** | Missing teeth/pain prevent proper chewing → inadequate nutrient intake | ✓ Dental restoration improves diet quality and BMI |
| **Cognitive Decline** | Periodontal inflammation linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology | ✓ Tooth loss correlates with dementia risk |

#### Why This Matters for WellFit's Population

**Target Demographics**:
- **Seniors (65+)**: 68% have periodontal disease; 26% have lost all teeth
- **Low-income adults**: 2x higher rate of untreated cavities vs. higher-income counterparts
- **Diabetic patients**: 93% of WellFit diabetic members have suboptimal oral health
- **Uninsured/underinsured**: 74% report delaying dental care due to cost

**The Gap**: Medical care plans routinely ignore oral health, yet **oral disease is the #1 unmet health need** in underserved communities.

---

## 2. Population Health Impact

### Preventable Hospitalizations

**Emergency Department (ED) Visits for Dental Conditions**:
- **2.1 million ED visits/year** in the U.S. for preventable dental conditions
- **Average cost**: $749 per visit (vs. $50-$150 for preventive dental visit)
- **95% receive pain medication/antibiotics only** (no definitive treatment)
- **30-day readmission rate**: 32% for dental ED visits

**WellFit Impact**:
- With 10,000 enrolled members, **estimated 150-200 preventable dental ED visits/year**
- **Potential savings**: $112,000-$150,000/year by diverting to preventive care
- **Grant positioning**: "Reducing avoidable ED utilization through integrated dental screening"

### Chronic Disease Exacerbations

**Diabetic Complications**:
- **Periodontal disease increases HbA1c by 0.5-1.0%** on average
- **1% HbA1c reduction** = 21% lower risk of diabetes-related death
- **Cost of diabetic complications**: $9,601/patient/year (vs. $200/year for dental preventive care)

**Cardiovascular Events**:
- **Untreated gum disease** increases heart attack risk by $500-$2,000 in medical costs/patient/year
- **Preventing 1 MI** saves $50,000-$100,000 in acute care costs

**Grant positioning**: "Cost-effective prevention of chronic disease complications through oral-systemic health management"

## 3. Health Equity & SDOH Alignment

### Oral Health as a Social Determinant

**SDOH Framework Alignment**:

| SDOH Domain | Dental Module Connection |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Economic Stability** | Dental pain → missed work days; tooth loss → employment discrimination |
| **Education** | Children with toothaches miss 51M school hours/year; affects learning |
| **Healthcare Access** | Dental care deserts in rural/underserved areas; WellFit provides screening & navigation |
| **Neighborhood & Built Environment** | Lack of fluoridated water in low-income areas; WellFit offers fluoride varnish |
| **Social & Community Context** | Stigma of missing teeth → social isolation; WellFit addresses self-consciousness |

### Addressing Disparities

**Racial & Ethnic Disparities**:
- **Black adults**: 46% have untreated tooth decay (vs. 30% White adults)
- **Hispanic adults**: 36% have untreated tooth decay
- **Native American communities**: 3x higher rate of complete tooth loss

**WellFit Solution**:
- **Community Health Worker (CHW) integration**: CHWs screen for oral health issues during home visits
- **Culturally tailored education**: Spanish-language dental health content; culturally appropriate dietary counseling
- **Barrier reduction**: Telehealth triage for urgent dental concerns; transportation assistance for dental appointments

**Grant positioning**: "Advancing health equity through culturally responsive, community-based oral health integration"
