## Template: Letter of Support from Clinical Partner

**[To be printed on Partner Organization Letterhead]**

**Date**: [Insert Date]

**To**: [Grant Funder Name]
**Re**: Letter of Support for WellFit Community Health Platform - Dental Health Module Integration

Dear [Grant Review Committee / Program Officer Name],

I am writing on behalf of **[Partner Organization Name]** to enthusiastically endorse the **WellFit Community Health Platform's Dental Health Module** proposal for **[Grant Program Name]** funding. As **[Title/Role]** of **[Organization]**, I have worked closely with WellFit and can attest to their commitment to innovative, evidence-based, and community-centered care.

### Our Partnership with WellFit

**[Partner Organization]** has collaborated with WellFit for **[X years/months]** in the following capacities:
- [e.g., Referral partnership for dental services]
- [e.g., Joint community health screenings]
- [e.g., Shared patient care coordination]
- [e.g., Clinical advisory board participation]

Through this partnership, we have witnessed **[specific positive outcomes, e.g., "improved access to preventive care for over 500 shared patients" or "reduction in avoidable ED visits among our mutual diabetic patient population"]**.

### The Critical Need for Dental Integration

In our community, **oral health is the #1 unmet health need**. We observe:
- **[Insert local statistic, e.g., "68% of our low-income patients report delaying dental care due to cost"]**
- **[Insert clinical observation, e.g., "30% of our diabetic patients have untreated gum disease that complicates glucose control"]**
- **[Insert health equity gap, e.g., "Hispanic/Latino patients face 2x longer wait times for dental specialist appointments"]**

The WellFit Dental Health Module directly addresses these gaps by:
- **Integrating oral health into chronic disease management** (linking periodontal disease treatment to HbA1c improvement)
- **Using Community Health Workers (CHWs)** to screen for oral health issues during home visits
- **Providing patient-facing technology** ("Smile Health" dashboard) for daily symptom tracking and education
- **Ensuring FHIR compliance** for seamless EHR integration across our health system

### Our Commitment to the Project

**[Partner Organization]** commits to supporting this initiative through:

✓ **Clinical Collaboration**:
- [e.g., "Accepting 100+ dental referrals annually from WellFit"]
- [e.g., "Providing specialist consultations (periodontist/endodontist) at discounted rates"]
- [e.g., "Sharing de-identified clinical data for program evaluation"]

✓ **Workforce Development**:
- [e.g., "Training WellFit CHWs in oral health screening protocols"]
- [e.g., "Providing continuing education credits for dental hygienists"]

✓ **Infrastructure Support**:
- [e.g., "Hosting dental hygienist 1 day/week at our community health center"]
- [e.g., "Donating portable dental screening equipment valued at $5,000"]

✓ **Evaluation & Quality Improvement**:
- [e.g., "Participating in quarterly care coordination meetings"]
- [e.g., "Contributing to outcomes tracking and program evaluation"]

### Expected Impact

We anticipate this partnership will:
- **Improve health outcomes**: Reduce HbA1c by 0.4% in diabetic patients with treated gum disease
- **Reduce healthcare costs**: Prevent 50+ dental-related ED visits annually (savings: $37,500)
- **Advance health equity**: Close the gap in untreated tooth decay between low-income and higher-income patients by 50%
- **Strengthen our safety net**: Demonstrate a replicable model for medical-dental integration across [region/state]

### Organizational Credentials

**[Partner Organization]** is a **[describe organization, e.g., "Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) serving 12,000 patients annually"]** with:
- **[X years]** of experience in **[relevant expertise, e.g., "community-based chronic disease management"]**
- **[Accreditations/certifications, e.g., "NCQA Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Level 3"]**
- **[Leadership role, e.g., "Member of the Regional Accountable Care Organization (ACO)"]**

Our CEO, **[Name]**, serves on the **[relevant board/coalition]**, and our Chief Medical Officer, **[Name]**, is a recognized expert in **[relevant field]**.

### Conclusion

The WellFit Dental Health Module represents a **strategic, evidence-based, and financially sustainable** approach to addressing oral health disparities. **[Partner Organization]** fully endorses this proposal and looks forward to a continued partnership that improves the health and well-being of our shared community.

## Template: Letter of Support from Community Organization

**[To be printed on Organization Letterhead]**

**Date**: [Insert Date]

**To**: [Grant Funder Name]
**Re**: Community Support for WellFit Dental Health Module

Dear [Grant Review Committee],

On behalf of **[Community Organization Name]**, I am pleased to express our strong support for WellFit Community Health Platform's proposal to expand dental health services through their innovative Dental Health Module.

### Our Organization's Mission

**[Community Organization]** is a **[type of organization, e.g., "grassroots nonprofit serving 2,000 seniors annually"]** dedicated to **[mission, e.g., "improving quality of life for low-income older adults through health education and social services"]**. For **[X years]**, we have worked alongside WellFit to **[describe collaboration]**.

### The Community Need

Our members—**[describe population, e.g., "predominantly Hispanic/Latino seniors aged 65+ with multiple chronic conditions"]**—face significant barriers to dental care:
- **74%** report they cannot afford dental care
- **52%** have avoided social events due to embarrassment about missing teeth
- **68%** report difficulty eating nutritious foods due to dental pain

These challenges directly impact their **diabetes management, cardiovascular health, and social isolation**—all priorities for our organization.

### How the Dental Module Aligns with Our Work

WellFit's Dental Health Module complements our existing programs:
- **[Program 1, e.g., "Nutrition education classes"]** → Dental health is essential for proper nutrition
- **[Program 2, e.g., "Diabetes support groups"]** → Gum disease treatment improves glucose control
- **[Program 3, e.g., "Social engagement activities"]** → Dental restoration reduces self-consciousness about smiling

### Our Commitment

**[Community Organization]** commits to:
- **Outreach & Enrollment**: Promote the Dental Health Module through our newsletter (circulation: 1,500), community events, and peer navigators
- **Space**: Provide meeting room for dental health education workshops (monthly, 2 hours)
- **Feedback**: Participate in focus groups and surveys to inform program improvement
- **Advocacy**: Amplify success stories to local media and policymakers

### Anticipated Impact

We believe this initiative will:
- **Reach 200+ of our members** in Year 1
- **Reduce isolation** by addressing the stigma of missing teeth
- **Improve chronic disease outcomes** by linking oral health to diabetes/heart disease management
- **Build community capacity** by training peer health ambassadors in oral health

**[Community Organization]** enthusiastically supports this proposal and is committed to its success.

Sincerely,
