| **Weather limitations** | [X] days/year with hazardous driving conditions |
| **Public transportation** | Limited or nonexistent |
| **Cost of travel** | Estimated $[X] per visit (gas, time off work) |

**Consequence:** Patients delay or skip appointments, leading to uncontrolled chronic conditions and preventable emergency department visits.

### Provider Shortages

| Provider Type | Ratio | Shortage |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Primary Care | 1:[X] population | [X]% below national average |
| Mental Health | 1:[X] population | [X]% below national average |

### Chronic Disease Burden

Our patient population carries a disproportionate burden of chronic disease:

| Condition | Local Rate | State Average | National Average |
|-----------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Hypertension | [X]% | [X]% | [X]% |
| Diabetes | [X]% | [X]% | [X]% |
| COPD | [X]% | [X]% | [X]% |
| Heart Disease | [X]% | [X]% | [X]% |
| Depression | [X]% | [X]% | [X]% |
| Obesity | [X]% | [X]% | [X]% |

### Current Technology Limitations

| Current State | Limitation |
|---------------|------------|
| Telehealth capability | Limited or none |

| Dual-eligible | [XXX] | [X]% |
| Age 65+ | [X,XXX] | [X]% |
| Racial/ethnic minorities | [XXX] | [X]% |
| Below poverty level | [XXX] | [X]% |

### Priority Populations

This project will prioritize:
1. **Patients with multiple chronic conditions** - highest need for monitoring
2. **Patients living >30 miles from clinic** - greatest transportation burden
