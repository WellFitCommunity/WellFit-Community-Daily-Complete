Baltimore, MD 21244

RE: Letter of Support for WellFit Community, LLC - ACCESS Model & NIH PAR-25-170

Dear Review Committee:

As a board-certified cardiologist with [XX] years of experience treating patients
with cardiovascular disease, I am writing to support WellFit Community's
applications to the CMS ACCESS Model and NIH PAR-25-170.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES

Heart failure, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
remain leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs among Medicare
beneficiaries. Current care models fall short because:

• Blood pressure is measured only during office visits (white coat effect)
• Heart failure decompensation is detected only when patients present to the ED
• Medication adherence rates for statins and antihypertensives are below 50%
• Social determinants significantly impact outcomes but are rarely addressed

REMOTE MONITORING VALUE

WellFit's platform addresses these gaps through:

1. CONTINUOUS BP MONITORING: Daily home readings with automatic transmission
   enable titration to goal and detect uncontrolled hypertension early

2. WEIGHT AND SYMPTOM TRACKING: Daily weight monitoring and symptom check-ins
   detect heart failure exacerbation before hospitalization is required

3. MEDICATION ADHERENCE: Reminder systems and acknowledgment tracking improve
   compliance with evidence-based therapies

4. WEARABLE DATA: Heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep data
   provide insights unavailable from periodic office visits

5. AI RISK STRATIFICATION: Predictive models identify high-risk patients for
   proactive intervention

CLINICAL COLLABORATION

I commit to serving as a cardiology consultant for WellFit's eCKM and CKM track
patients, including:

• Reviewing complex cases and providing specialist recommendations

RE: Letter of Support for WellFit Community, LLC

Dear Review Committee:

I am an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes management, and I enthusiastically
support WellFit Community's applications to the CMS ACCESS Model and NIH PAR-25-170.

THE DIABETES MANAGEMENT CRISIS

Over 14 million Medicare beneficiaries have diabetes, with associated costs
exceeding $200 billion annually. Despite advances in pharmacotherapy, outcomes
remain poor:

• Only 50% of patients achieve A1c <7%
• Diabetes-related complications continue to rise
• 30-day readmission rates for diabetes exceed 20%
• Socioeconomic factors significantly impact glycemic control

TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED DIABETES CARE

WellFit's CKM track offers compelling solutions:

1. CGM INTEGRATION: Continuous glucose data enables real-time pattern recognition
   and medication adjustment without waiting for quarterly A1c tests

2. BEHAVIORAL COACHING: Daily engagement supports lifestyle modification—the
   foundation of diabetes management

3. MEDICATION MANAGEMENT: Complex diabetes regimens (insulin + oral agents +
   GLP-1s) require adherence support that office visits cannot provide

4. COMPLICATION MONITORING: Integrated tracking for nephropathy (eGFR trends),
   retinopathy screening, and foot care

5. SDOH DETECTION: Food insecurity and medication cost concerns significantly
   impact diabetes control; passive detection enables intervention

RESEARCH VALUE (NIH PAR-25-170)

For the NIH application, I see significant scientific value in validating:

• Glucose variability metrics as predictors of complication development
• CGM-derived time-in-range as a clinical trial endpoint
• Behavioral biomarkers (check-in patterns, dietary logging) as adherence proxies
• Integration of physiological and behavioral data for outcome prediction

These digital biomarkers could accelerate diabetes clinical trials and enable
precision approaches to diabetes management.

COMMITMENT

I will serve as an endocrinology consultant for WellFit, providing clinical
oversight for diabetes protocols and supporting research activities.

for digital biomarker validation.

THE NEED FOR PARKINSON'S DIGITAL BIOMARKERS

Parkinson's disease affects over 1 million Americans, with prevalence expected
to double by 2040. Current clinical assessment methods are inadequate:

• UPDRS scores are assessed only during clinic visits (4x/year typically)
• Motor fluctuations occur unpredictably and are poorly captured
• Medication timing adherence is critical but unmonitored
• Falls occur between visits without documentation
• Non-motor symptoms (sleep, mood) significantly impact quality of life

Digital biomarkers could revolutionize PD monitoring and clinical trial design.

WELLFIT'S PARKINSON'S CAPABILITIES

I have reviewed WellFit's Neuro Suite and am impressed by their capabilities:

1. TREMOR MONITORING: Wearable accelerometer data can quantify tremor amplitude
   and frequency continuously

2. GAIT ANALYSIS: Step patterns, stride variability, and walking speed from
   wearables correlate with fall risk

3. SLEEP TRACKING: Sleep architecture changes predict next-day motor function
   and disease progression

4. MEDICATION TIMING: Precise tracking of levodopa timing is essential for
   managing motor fluctuations

5. NIHSS INTEGRATION: Their stroke assessment dashboard demonstrates clinical
   rigor applicable to PD

RESEARCH COMMITMENT

For the NIH study, I commit to:

• Serving as Parkinson's Disease Clinical Advisor
• Recruiting [XX] PD patients from my practice for the validation study
• Providing UPDRS assessments for gold-standard comparison
• Advising on clinically meaningful digital biomarker thresholds
• Contributing to manuscript development and publication

SCIENTIFIC MERIT

The proposed study will generate critical evidence for:

• Continuous tremor amplitude as a UPDRS motor score surrogate
• Sleep disruption patterns predicting motor fluctuations
• Gait metrics as fall risk biomarkers
• Medication timing patterns as adherence measures

These biomarkers could serve as endpoints in PD clinical trials, accelerating
therapeutic development.

I enthusiastically support this application.

As a pulmonologist specializing in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
I support WellFit Community's NIH application to validate digital biomarkers for
remote COPD monitoring.

COPD MONITORING GAPS

COPD is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., with acute exacerbations
driving morbidity and mortality. Current management fails because:

• Exacerbations are detected only when patients present to emergency care
• Spirometry requires clinic visits and is effort-dependent
• Symptom diaries have poor adherence
• Oxygen saturation is checked only sporadically
• Activity limitation—a key outcome—is poorly measured

DIGITAL BIOMARKER POTENTIAL

WellFit's platform could transform COPD monitoring:

1. CONTINUOUS SpO2: Wearable pulse oximetry detects desaturation trends before
   symptomatic decline

2. RESPIRATORY RATE: Elevated respiratory rate may precede exacerbations by days

3. ACTIVITY MONITORING: Step counts and activity patterns objectively measure
   functional status and decline

4. SYMPTOM CHECK-INS: Daily digital assessments (CAT score elements) detect
   worsening earlier than periodic clinic visits

5. MEDICATION ADHERENCE: Inhaler use tracking ensures maintenance therapy
   compliance

RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION

For the NIH study, I will:

• Serve as COPD Clinical Advisor
• Enroll [XX] COPD patients (GOLD stages 2-4) from my practice
• Provide spirometry and 6-minute walk testing for validation
• Adjudicate exacerbation outcomes
• Contribute pulmonology expertise to study design and analysis

SCIENTIFIC VALUE

Validated COPD digital biomarkers would:

• Enable earlier exacerbation detection and treatment
• Provide continuous endpoints for pharmaceutical trials
• Support precision approaches to COPD management
• Reduce hospitalizations through proactive intervention

I strongly endorse this application.
