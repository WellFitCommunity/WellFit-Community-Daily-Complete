# PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT

**Background:** Chronic diseases account for 90% of U.S. healthcare expenditure, yet preventable hospitalizations continue to rise due to delayed interventions and fragmented care coordination. While AI-powered clinical decision support (CDS) systems show promise for identifying high-risk patients, few have been rigorously validated in real-world primary care settings with diverse patient populations.

**Objective:** This project will evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of an AI-powered clinical decision support platform (Envision Atlus) that integrates 45+ machine learning models for chronic disease risk stratification, care gap identification, and care coordination optimization in primary care settings serving underserved populations.

**Methods:**
- **R21 Phase (Years 1-2):** Implement the Envision Atlus CDS platform at 3 primary care sites serving diverse populations. Conduct usability testing, workflow integration assessment, and preliminary effectiveness evaluation. Establish baseline metrics and refine algorithms based on clinical feedback.
- **R33 Phase (Years 3-5):** Expand to 10 primary care sites across urban and rural settings. Conduct a cluster-randomized trial comparing CDS-enhanced care to usual care. Measure impact on quality metrics, care coordination, patient outcomes, and healthcare utilization.

**Outcomes:**
- Primary: Reduction in preventable hospitalizations for chronic conditions (CHF, COPD, diabetes)
- Secondary: Improvement in care gap closure rates, patient-reported outcomes, provider workflow efficiency
- Safety: Monitoring for alert fatigue, automation bias, and unintended consequences

**Innovation:** This study will be among the first to evaluate a comprehensive multi-condition AI CDS system integrated with FHIR-based interoperability, passive social determinants of health (SDOH) detection, and real-time care coordination in diverse primary care settings.

**Public Health Relevance:** Successful validation will provide evidence-based guidance for implementing AI CDS systems to reduce health disparities, improve chronic disease outcomes, and enhance care coordination across the U.S. healthcare system.

# SPECIFIC AIMS

Chronic diseases affect 6 in 10 American adults and drive 90% of healthcare spending ($4.5 trillion annually). Despite advances in clinical decision support (CDS) technology, preventable hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions remain stubbornly high—especially among underserved populations who face fragmented care, limited access, and unaddressed social needs. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers unprecedented potential to identify high-risk patients before clinical deterioration, but rigorous real-world evidence on implementation, effectiveness, and equity impact remains limited.

**Envision Atlus** is an AI-powered clinical care management platform with 45+ validated machine learning models for risk stratification, including heart failure exacerbation (AUC 0.87), COPD deterioration (AUC 0.84), diabetes complications (AUC 0.82), fall risk (AUC 0.85), and 30-day readmission (AUC 0.79). The platform integrates FHIR R4 interoperability (77% US Core compliance), passive SDOH detection via natural language processing (26 categories), and care coordination workflows—yet has not been formally evaluated in a multi-site clinical trial.

**The central hypothesis** is that AI-powered CDS integrated into primary care workflows will reduce preventable hospitalizations, improve quality metric performance, and enhance care coordination efficiency—with equitable benefits across demographic groups.

**The long-term goal** is to establish evidence-based best practices for implementing AI CDS systems in diverse healthcare settings to reduce chronic disease burden and health disparities.

## Aim 1 (R21): Implement and optimize AI-powered CDS in primary care settings

**Aim 1a:** Deploy the Envision Atlus CDS platform at 3 primary care sites serving diverse populations (1 urban safety-net clinic, 1 FQHC, 1 rural health clinic) and assess implementation barriers and facilitators using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).

**Aim 1b:** Evaluate usability, workflow integration, and provider acceptance using mixed methods (System Usability Scale, semi-structured interviews, time-motion studies).

**Aim 1c:** Refine CDS algorithms and alert thresholds based on clinician feedback and preliminary outcome data, establishing performance benchmarks for the R33 phase.

**Deliverables:** Optimized CDS configuration, implementation toolkit, preliminary effectiveness estimates, R33 trial protocol.

## Aim 2 (R33): Evaluate effectiveness of AI-powered CDS on patient outcomes

**Aim 2a:** Conduct a cluster-randomized trial at 10 primary care sites (5 intervention, 5 control) to evaluate the impact of AI CDS on preventable hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (primary outcome).

**Aim 2b:** Assess secondary outcomes including care gap closure rates (HbA1c testing, nephropathy screening, annual wellness visits), patient-reported outcomes (PROMIS-29), emergency department utilization, and total cost of care.

**Aim 2c:** Examine heterogeneity of treatment effects across patient subgroups (age, race/ethnicity, rurality, comorbidity burden, SDOH risk factors) to evaluate equity impact.

**Deliverables:** Effectiveness estimates, equity analysis, implementation cost data, policy recommendations.

## Aim 3 (R33): Assess safety and sustainability of AI-powered CDS

**Aim 3a:** Monitor for unintended consequences including alert fatigue (alert dismissal rates), automation bias (over-reliance on AI recommendations), and disparate impact across demographic groups.

**Aim 3b:** Conduct economic evaluation including implementation costs, ongoing maintenance costs, and return on investment from reduced hospitalizations.

**Aim 3c:** Develop sustainability and dissemination plan including business model, training materials, and technical assistance resources for broader adoption.

**Deliverables:** Safety monitoring framework, economic analysis, dissemination toolkit, peer-reviewed publications.

# RESEARCH STRATEGY

## A. SIGNIFICANCE

### A.1. Chronic Disease Burden and Quality Gaps

Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, affecting 133 million Americans (40% of the population) and accounting for 90% of healthcare expenditure. Heart failure alone affects 6.2 million Americans with annual costs exceeding $30 billion. Despite proven interventions, quality gaps persist:

| Quality Gap | National Performance | Target |
|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| HbA1c testing (diabetics) | 77% | 90% |
| Nephropathy screening | 65% | 85% |
| Heart failure medication adherence | 58% | 80% |
| COPD maintenance therapy | 62% | 80% |
| Depression follow-up | 54% | 75% |

### A.2. Promise and Limitations of Clinical Decision Support

Clinical decision support systems have demonstrated efficacy in improving quality metrics and reducing errors. However, traditional rule-based CDS systems suffer from limitations:

- **Alert fatigue:** Clinicians override 49-96% of drug alerts
- **Limited scope:** Most CDS addresses single conditions
- **Poor integration:** Standalone systems disrupt workflow
- **Disparate impact:** One-size-fits-all thresholds may disadvantage minority populations

AI-powered CDS offers potential advantages through personalized risk prediction, multi-condition integration, and continuous learning. However, rigorous real-world evidence is lacking, particularly for:
- Multi-site implementation in diverse settings
- Equity impact across demographic groups
- Long-term sustainability and scalability
- Safety monitoring for unintended consequences

### A.3. Knowledge Gaps This Project Addresses

| Gap | How This Project Addresses It |
|-----|-------------------------------|
| Limited multi-site AI CDS trials | 10-site cluster-randomized trial |
| Equity impact unknown | Pre-specified subgroup analyses |
| Implementation barriers unclear | CFIR-guided implementation evaluation |
| Safety concerns unaddressed | Systematic adverse event monitoring |
| Sustainability uncertain | Economic evaluation and business model |

### A.4. Health Equity Focus

This project specifically targets health disparities by:
- Including safety-net clinics, FQHCs, and rural health clinics
- Recruiting diverse patient populations (target: 50% minority)
- Integrating passive SDOH detection (26 categories)
- Pre-specifying equity analyses
- Monitoring for algorithmic bias
