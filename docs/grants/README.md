# NOTES

## Grant Writing Tips

1. **Start with the reviewer** - What do they need to say "yes"?
2. **Be specific** - Numbers, names, dates, not vague promises
3. **Show capability** - Platform is production-ready, not vaporware
4. **Address sustainability** - How does this continue after grant?
5. **Health equity matters** - Rural, underserved, diverse populations

## Partnership Development Tips

1. **Lead with value** - What's in it for them?
2. **Minimize their burden** - We do the work
3. **Be patient** - Rural health leaders are busy
4. **Use intermediaries** - SORH and associations open doors
5. **Build relationships** - Even if this grant doesn't work, next one might
