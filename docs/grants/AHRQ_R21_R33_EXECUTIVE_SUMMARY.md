## ONE-PAGE SUMMARY

### The Problem

Chronic diseases affect 133 million Americans and consume 90% of healthcare spending. Despite advances in clinical decision support (CDS), preventable hospitalizations remain high due to:
- Alert fatigue (clinicians override 49-96% of alerts)
- Limited single-disease CDS systems
- Poor EHR integration disrupting workflows
- Unknown equity impact across populations
