# OUTREACH LETTER - CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL

```
[WELLFIT COMMUNITY LETTERHEAD]

[Date]

[CEO/Administrator Name]
[Hospital Name]
[Address]
[City, State ZIP]

Dear [Name],

RE: Partnership Opportunity - Federal Funding for Rural Telehealth & Remote Monitoring

I am writing to explore a partnership that could bring significant federal funding
to [Hospital Name] for telehealth and remote patient monitoring technology—with
minimal cost to your organization.

THE OPPORTUNITY

WellFit Community is a healthcare technology company seeking rural partners to
jointly apply for federal grants, including:

• USDA Distance Learning & Telemedicine Grants (up to $1 million)
• HRSA Rural Health Network Development ($900,000 over 3 years)
• CMS ACCESS Model (ongoing payment for technology-enabled chronic care)

These programs fund the equipment, software, and training needed to deliver
technology-enabled care to your patients with chronic conditions.

WHY CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS?

As a CAH, you serve patients who travel long distances for care, have limited
access to specialists, and often delay treatment due to transportation barriers.
Our technology addresses these challenges by enabling:

• Video visits for routine follow-ups (reducing patient travel)
• Home blood pressure, glucose, and oxygen monitoring
• Early detection of deterioration before emergency care is needed
• Specialist consultations via telehealth

I understand the resource constraints CAHs face. That's why we've structured
this partnership to minimize your burden:

WHAT WELLFIT PROVIDES                    WHAT YOU PROVIDE
───────────────────────                  ─────────────────
✓ Grant writing (we do the work)        ✓ Serve as lead applicant
✓ Technology platform (3-year license)  ✓ 15% match (staff time counts)
✓ 500+ monitoring devices               ✓ Patients to enroll
✓ Staff training                        ✓ Clinical oversight
✓ Ongoing technical support             ✓ Outcome reporting
✓ Implementation management

THE IMPACT FOR YOUR PATIENTS

Based on similar deployments, we project:

• 500 patients enrolled in remote monitoring
• 50% reduction in miles traveled for routine care
• 20% reduction in avoidable ED visits
• Improved chronic disease control (hypertension, diabetes, COPD)
• Enhanced patient satisfaction and loyalty

FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY

After the grant period, the program can be sustained through Medicare
reimbursement for Remote Patient Monitoring (CPT 99453-99458) and Chronic Care
Management (CPT 99490). We'll help you establish billing workflows during the
grant period.

NEXT STEPS

I would welcome 30 minutes of your time to discuss whether this partnership
aligns with [Hospital Name]'s strategic priorities. I'm available at your
convenience and happy to meet in person, by video, or by phone.

Please feel free to contact me directly at [phone] or maria@wellfitcommunity.com.

Sincerely,

Maria Gonzalez-Smithfield
Chief Executive Officer
WellFit Community, LLC

Enclosure: Partnership One-Pager

P.S. The USDA DLT grant application deadline is expected in Spring 2026. To be
competitive, we should begin partnership discussions by [date]. I look forward
to connecting with you.

# OUTREACH LETTER - FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER

```
[WELLFIT COMMUNITY LETTERHEAD]

[Date]

[CEO Name]
[FQHC Name]
[Address]
[City, State ZIP]

Dear [Name],

RE: Technology Partnership to Extend Your Reach to Rural Patients

As an FQHC leader, you've dedicated your career to serving those who face the
greatest barriers to healthcare. I'm reaching out because WellFit Community
shares that mission—and we have an opportunity to significantly expand your
capacity to serve rural patients through federal grant funding.

THE CHALLENGE WE CAN ADDRESS TOGETHER

Your rural patients face unique obstacles:
• Long travel times to reach your health center
• Missed appointments due to transportation, work, or childcare
• Chronic conditions that worsen between visits
• Limited access to specialty care
• Social determinants that affect health outcomes

THE SOLUTION: TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED CARE

WellFit Community has developed a comprehensive digital health platform designed
for underserved populations, including:

• TELEHEALTH: Video visits that eliminate travel barriers
• REMOTE MONITORING: Bluetooth devices that transmit vitals daily
• CARE COORDINATION: Tools to manage complex patients proactively
• SDOH DETECTION: AI that identifies social needs from clinical notes
• PATIENT ENGAGEMENT: Daily check-ins with senior-friendly design

Our platform was built for the populations FQHCs serve—older adults, people
with limited technology experience, and those facing social challenges.

THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY

We seek FQHC partners to jointly apply for federal grants:

┌────────────────────────────┬─────────────┬────────────────────────────────┐
│ Program                    │ Funding     │ Best For                       │
├────────────────────────────┼─────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ USDA DLT Grants            │ Up to $1M   │ Equipment and technology       │
│ HRSA Network Development   │ $900K/3 yrs │ Multi-site care coordination   │
│ HRSA RCORP-Impact          │ $4M/4 yrs   │ Behavioral health/SUD services │
│ CMS ACCESS Model           │ Ongoing     │ Chronic care reimbursement     │
└────────────────────────────┴─────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘

As the lead applicant, your FQHC would apply; we provide the technology and
write the grant. Your only cost is 15% match—which can be satisfied with
staff time.

WHY PARTNER WITH WELLFIT?

1. MISSION ALIGNMENT: We exist to improve healthcare for underserved communities
2. GRANT EXPERTISE: We've developed comprehensive applications ready to customize
3. PRODUCTION-READY PLATFORM: 8 months of development, 6,600+ automated tests
4. HEALTH EQUITY FOCUS: Platform designed for seniors and those with barriers
5. SUSTAINABILITY PATH: We help establish RPM/CCM billing for long-term revenue

PATIENT OUTCOMES WE CAN ACHIEVE TOGETHER

• 500+ patients enrolled in remote monitoring
• Improved diabetes control (A1c <7.5% for 60% of patients)
• Improved hypertension control (BP <140/90 for 70% of patients)
• 20% reduction in preventable ED visits
• Reduced travel burden for your most vulnerable patients

I would be honored to discuss how this partnership could advance [FQHC Name]'s
mission. May I schedule a brief call to explore the possibilities?

With respect for your important work,

Maria Gonzalez-Smithfield
Chief Executive Officer
WellFit Community, LLC
maria@wellfitcommunity.com
[Phone Number]

P.S. We especially welcome FQHCs serving Health Professional Shortage Areas
(HPSAs) and Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs), as these designations
strengthen grant competitiveness.

# OUTREACH LETTER - RURAL HEALTH CLINIC

```
[WELLFIT COMMUNITY LETTERHEAD]

[Date]

[Medical Director/Administrator Name]
[Rural Health Clinic Name]
[Address]
[City, State ZIP]

Dear [Dr./Name],

RE: Free Technology for Your Chronic Disease Patients (Federal Grant Opportunity)

What if you could monitor your patients with hypertension, diabetes, and COPD
every day—not just when they come to the clinic?

I'm reaching out because federal grant programs can fund exactly this capability
for Rural Health Clinics like yours, and WellFit Community is looking for
partners to apply together.

THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW TOO WELL

Your patients with chronic conditions:
• See you every 3-6 months, but their conditions change daily
• Travel 30+ miles for a 15-minute visit
• Skip appointments when weather, work, or health makes travel difficult
• End up in the ED when conditions deteriorate between visits
• Struggle to afford medications, let alone monitoring devices

THE SOLUTION: REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING

With grant funding, we can equip your patients with:

┌──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Device                   │ What It Does                                   │
├──────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Bluetooth BP monitor     │ Daily readings transmitted automatically       │
│ Bluetooth scale          │ Weight trends for heart failure patients       │
│ Pulse oximeter           │ SpO2 monitoring for COPD patients              │
│ Glucose meter            │ Blood sugar tracking for diabetics             │
│ Fitness wearable         │ Activity, sleep, heart rate for all patients   │
└──────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

All data flows to a dashboard you can review during clinic hours—or our care
coordinators can monitor and alert you to problems.

THE OPPORTUNITY

• USDA Distance Learning & Telemedicine Grants: Up to $1 million
• Your cost: 15% match (staff time qualifies)
• Project period: 3 years
• What you get: Devices, telehealth platform, training, support

WE DO THE HEAVY LIFTING

┌────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ WellFit Handles                │ You Provide                            │
├────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Write the grant application    │ Sign as lead applicant                 │
│ Provide all technology         │ 15% match (in-kind OK)                 │
│ Train your staff               │ Enroll your chronic disease patients   │
│ Support implementation         │ Review data and adjust care            │
│ Manage reporting               │ Continue excellent patient care        │
└────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘

REAL IMPACT FOR YOUR PRACTICE

• Monitor 200-500 patients remotely
• Reduce phone calls asking "how's my blood pressure?"
• Catch problems before they become emergencies
• Bill Medicare for Remote Patient Monitoring ($50-100/patient/month)
• Differentiate your practice in your community

I'd love to spend 20 minutes on the phone explaining how this works and
whether it's a fit for [Clinic Name]. No obligation—just information.

Can I call you next week, or would you prefer to schedule at
[calendar link]?

Best regards,

Maria Gonzalez-Smithfield
CEO, WellFit Community

P.S. RHCs with Medicare Flex Program experience or prior USDA/HRSA grants
are especially well-positioned for this opportunity.

Dear [Name],

RE: Technology Partnership for Tribal Health - Federal Funding Opportunity

I write with deep respect for the sovereign healthcare systems serving Native
communities and with an opportunity that may help address the healthcare access

remote monitoring technology. These programs—including USDA Distance Learning &
Telemedicine grants—provide priority consideration for Tribal applicants.

THE CHALLENGES WE UNDERSTAND

Native communities, particularly in rural and frontier areas, face some of the
most significant healthcare access barriers in the nation:

• Vast distances to healthcare facilities
• High rates of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease
• Limited specialty care access
• Healthcare workforce shortages
• Unique cultural and language considerations

THE OPPORTUNITY

Federal grants can fund technology that addresses these challenges:

• TELEHEALTH PLATFORM: Video visits connecting patients with providers across
  distances, reducing travel burden and enabling more frequent check-ins

• REMOTE MONITORING DEVICES: Blood pressure monitors, glucose meters, and
  wearables that transmit data to your clinical team daily

• CARE COORDINATION TOOLS: Platform to manage chronic disease patients
  proactively, with alerts when intervention is needed

• CULTURAL CUSTOMIZATION: We commit to adapting the platform to honor your
  community's preferences and needs

If you have 15 minutes this week or next, I'd love to explain the
opportunity and answer any questions. No obligation.

# FAQ FOR PARTNERS

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About the Partnership

**Q: What exactly is WellFit Community?**

A: We're a healthcare technology company based in San Antonio, Texas. We've built
a digital health platform with telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and care
coordination tools—specifically designed for underserved populations and older
adults.

**Q: Why do you need a rural partner?**

A: Federal programs like USDA DLT require the applicant to be a healthcare
provider serving rural communities. We have the technology; you have the
patients and the eligibility. Together, we can bring resources to your community.

**Q: What's in it for WellFit?**

A: Honestly, we want to grow our platform's reach and demonstrate impact in
rural communities. These grants fund our technology deployment. We also believe
rural Americans deserve the same healthcare technology as urban areas.

### About the Grants

**Q: How much work is the grant application?**

A: We do the heavy lifting. We'll draft the entire application based on
information you provide about your community and patients. You review, sign,
and submit.

**Q: What's the 15% match, and can we really use staff time?**

A: Yes. The match can be in-kind contributions. Staff time spent on the project
(coordinator, nurses reviewing data, etc.) counts. We'll help you document it
properly.

**Q: What if we don't get the grant?**

A: No cost to you—we absorb the time spent on the application. And we can try
again in the next funding cycle or explore other grant programs.

**Q: Are there strings attached?**

A: The grant has standard federal reporting requirements (quarterly reports,
outcome data). We help you meet those. There's no obligation to WellFit beyond
the grant period, though we hope you'll want to continue.

### About the Technology

**Q: Do our patients need smartphones or internet?**

A: Not necessarily. The monitoring devices transmit via Bluetooth to a hub or
phone, but we can provide cellular-enabled solutions for patients without
internet. The platform also works on basic tablets we can provide.

**Q: Is this HIPAA compliant?**

A: Absolutely. Our platform is built to HIPAA standards with encryption, access
controls, and audit logging. We sign BAAs with all partners.

**Q: What if patients can't use the technology?**

A: We've designed for older adults and those with limited technology experience.
Large buttons, simple interfaces, and we provide training. We can also include
caregiver access for patients who need support.

**Q: What happens after the grant ends?**

A: The devices belong to you. For the platform, you can continue at a
subscription rate, or we'll help you transition to another solution. We also
help establish Medicare billing (RPM codes) during the grant so you have
sustainable revenue.

### About Working Together

**Q: How much of our staff time is required?**

A: During setup: moderate (training, workflow design). Ongoing: minimal—mainly
reviewing alerts and incorporating data into patient care. We provide care
coordination support to handle the day-to-day.

**Q: Who makes clinical decisions?**

A: You do. Always. Our technology surfaces information and alerts; your
clinicians make all care decisions. The AI provides decision support, not
decision replacement.

**Q: What if this doesn't work for our community?**

A: That's what the discovery call is for. We'll be honest if we don't think
it's a good fit. Better to know upfront than waste everyone's time.
