## 4. Recovery Procedures

### 4.1 Database Recovery - Complete Loss

**Estimated RTO:** 2-4 hours
**Prerequisites:** Incident Commander authorization, Security clearance

#### Step-by-Step Procedure

**Step 1: Incident Declaration (0-15 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Declare incident
./scripts/disaster-recovery/declare-incident.sh \
  --severity=P0 \
  --type=database_loss \
  --notifyTeam=true

# 2. Activate recovery team
# Send automated notifications via Twilio/email

# 3. Document incident start time
echo "Incident started: $(date -Iseconds)" >> incident-log.txt
```

**Step 2: Assess Damage (15-30 minutes)**
```sql
-- Check database accessibility
SELECT current_database(), version(), now();

-- Check table integrity
SELECT schemaname, tablename,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename))
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Check last known good backup
SELECT * FROM backup_verification_logs
WHERE verification_status = 'success'
ORDER BY backup_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Step 3: Isolate Systems (30-45 minutes)**
```bash
# Stop application (prevent data corruption)
npx supabase functions deploy --all --no-verify-jwt

# Enable maintenance mode
export MAINTENANCE_MODE=true

# Redirect traffic to static maintenance page
# Update DNS or load balancer configuration
```

**Step 4: Execute Restoration (45-120 minutes)**
```bash
# Connect to Supabase CLI
npx supabase login

# List available backups
npx supabase db remote commit list

# Restore to point-in-time (adjust timestamp)
npx supabase db restore \
  --db-url "postgresql://postgres.xkybsjnvuohpqpbkikyn:${DB_PASSWORD}@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres" \
  --timestamp "2025-10-23T12:00:00Z"

# OR restore from specific backup
npx supabase db reset --db-url "${DATABASE_URL}"
```

**Step 5: Verify Data Integrity (120-180 minutes)**
```sql
-- Run automated verification
SELECT verify_database_backup();

-- Check critical tables
SELECT
  'profiles' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM profiles
UNION ALL
SELECT 'fhir_observations', COUNT(*) FROM fhir_observations
UNION ALL
SELECT 'fhir_medication_requests', COUNT(*) FROM fhir_medication_requests
UNION ALL
SELECT 'fhir_conditions', COUNT(*) FROM fhir_conditions;

-- Check referential integrity
DO $$
DECLARE
  v_integrity_check BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  -- Verify foreign key constraints
  PERFORM * FROM profiles WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users);
  IF FOUND THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Data integrity violation: orphaned profiles';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Test critical functions
SELECT test_backup_restore('database');
```

**Step 6: Test Application Functionality (180-210 minutes)**
```bash
# Run smoke tests
npm run test:integration

# Test authentication
curl -X POST "${API_URL}/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'

# Test FHIR endpoints
curl "${API_URL}/fhir/Patient/123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TEST_TOKEN}"

# Verify RLS policies
psql "${DATABASE_URL}" -c "SELECT * FROM profiles LIMIT 1;"
```

**Step 7: Resume Operations (210-240 minutes)**
```bash
# Disable maintenance mode
export MAINTENANCE_MODE=false

# Deploy functions
npx supabase functions deploy --all

# Monitor for errors
tail -f /var/log/application.log

# Announce recovery complete
./scripts/disaster-recovery/announce-recovery.sh
```

**Step 8: Post-Incident Review (Within 48 hours)**
- Document timeline
- Calculate actual RTO/RPO
- Identify improvements
- Update runbooks
- File compliance reports (if PHI affected)

---

### 4.2 Partial Database Corruption

**Estimated RTO:** 1-2 hours

```sql
-- Identify corrupted tables
SELECT tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(tablename::regclass))
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Restore specific table from backup
CREATE TABLE profiles_backup AS SELECT * FROM profiles;
DROP TABLE profiles CASCADE;
-- Restore from backup
-- Recreate foreign keys and indexes
```

---

### 4.3 Security Breach / Ransomware

**Estimated RTO:** 4-8 hours (includes security audit)

```bash
# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-15 minutes)
# 1. Isolate affected systems
# 2. Preserve evidence (logs, snapshots)
# 3. Notify security team
# 4. Contact incident response partner

# CONTAINMENT (15-60 minutes)
# 1. Revoke all API keys
# 2. Force password resets
# 3. Enable enhanced monitoring
# 4. Deploy WAF rules

# RECOVERY (60-240 minutes)
# 1. Restore from clean backup (verified pre-breach)
# 2. Scan restored data for malware
# 3. Apply security patches
# 4. Enhanced security monitoring

# COMPLIANCE (Within 72 hours for HIPAA)
# 1. Breach notification preparation
# 2. HHS reporting (if >500 individuals)
# 3. Individual notifications
# 4. State AG notifications
# 5. Media notification (if >500 individuals)
