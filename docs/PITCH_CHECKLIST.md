## ðŸŽ¯ During Pitch

### Introduction (2 min)
- [ ] Thank them for their time
- [ ] Ask: "What are your biggest challenges right now?"
- [ ] Listen! Take notes on what they say
- [ ] Tailor demo to their pain points

### Demo (10-12 min)
- [ ] **If they said "staff shortage"** â†’ Show mobile nurse dashboard
- [ ] **If they said "compliance/audit"** â†’ Show security dashboard
- [ ] **If they said "revenue/billing"** â†’ Show CCM tracking
- [ ] **If they said "burnout"** â†’ Show AI scribe + resilience hub

### Always Show These 3 Things:
1. [ ] Nurse handoff (patient safety)
2. [ ] Security audit log (compliance)
3. [ ] CCM time tracking (revenue)

### Questions to Ask Them:
- [ ] "How do you currently handle shift handoffs?"
- [ ] "How many CCM patients do you have?"
- [ ] "What does your IT team need from us?"
- [ ] "What would success look like in 90 days?"

---

## ðŸ’° Pricing Discussion

### Rural Hospital (Recommended)
- [ ] $5/patient/month model
- [ ] Calculate: "For 200 active patients, that's $1,000/month"
- [ ] Show ROI: "10 CCM patients = $7,800/year = 7.8x ROI"

### Pilot Offer
- [ ] 3 months at 50% off
- [ ] 1-2 units only
- [ ] Full support included
- [ ] No long-term contract required

---

## ðŸš¨ Objection Responses (Have These Ready)

### "We have an EHR already"
**Say**: "Perfect! We integrate via FHIR. We're not replacing your EHR - we're adding care coordination that EHRs don't do well."

### "Too expensive"
**Say**: "Let me show you the math. If we help you capture just [X] more CCM patients per month at $65 each, that's [Y]/year. We pay for ourselves."

### "Staff won't use it"
**Say**: "That's why it's mobile-first. Your nurses already use their phones. We're just giving them a better tool. Training is 2 hours."

### "Security concerns"
**Say**: [Hand them SOC2 doc] "We're SOC2 Type 2 certified with the same security as Epic and Cerner. Full audit trails, encrypted data, HIPAA compliant."

### "Need to think about it"
**Say**: "Absolutely. What if we started with a small pilot - just 1-2 units for 3 months? No long-term commitment, and I'll give you 50% off to prove the value."

## âœ… Closing the Meeting

### Get Commitment:
- [ ] "What are your next steps?"
- [ ] "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- [ ] "Can we schedule a pilot kick-off for [DATE]?"

### Set Follow-Up:
- [ ] Schedule next call/meeting before you leave
- [ ] "I'll send the proposal by [TOMORROW/DAY]"
- [ ] "Let's reconnect on [SPECIFIC DATE]"

### Leave Behind:
- [ ] Business card
- [ ] One-pager summary (if you have)
- [ ] "I'll email you the SOC2 docs tonight"

## ðŸ”¥ Power Tips

### Demo Tips:
- **Start with mobile** - rural nurses love this
- **Show real data** - not fake/lorem ipsum
- **Let THEM click** - hands-on is powerful
- **Slow down** - they need to absorb

### Rapport Building:
- Research their hospital (Google, LinkedIn)
- Mention other rural hospitals you work with
- Ask about THEIR challenges (don't just pitch)
- Be genuine - you're solving real problems

### Closing Tips:
- Always ask for the pilot (not the full sale)
- Make it risk-free (no long-term contract)
- Create urgency ("We have 2 pilot slots open in [MONTH]")
- Get a commitment before you leave

## ðŸ“ž Emergency Contacts During Demo

**If demo breaks**:
- Have backup: screenshots/video
- Say: "Let me show you a quick video while we reconnect"
- Use phone hotspot if WiFi fails

**If you don't know the answer**:
- NEVER lie or guess
- Say: "Great question! Let me verify that and email you by EOD"
- Follow up same day
