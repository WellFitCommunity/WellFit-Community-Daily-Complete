## Script - Scene by Scene

---

### SCENE 1: Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:20)

**Screen:** `/law-enforcement` (The SHIELD Program landing page)

**Voiceover:**
> "This is a working, production-grade healthcare platform. Not a prototype - not a pitch deck. Every screen you're about to see is live software, built entirely with Claude by a two-person team: a Registered Nurse and an AI Director. No engineering department. Let me show you what 40 AI services look like in production."

**Action:** Pause on the SHIELD Program hero section. Let the viewer see the full landing page with the shield icon, the title "The SHIELD Program," and the subtitle "Senior & Health-Impaired Emergency Liaison Dispatch."

---

### SCENE 2: The SHIELD Program - Senior Welfare (0:20 - 1:00)

**Screen:** Still on `/law-enforcement`

**Voiceover:**
> "We'll start with our social impact vertical. The SHIELD Program is a senior welfare check system designed for law enforcement agencies. Seniors enrolled in the program receive daily check-ins. If they miss a check-in, the system automatically escalates - notifying family contacts by SMS, then dispatching a constable for a welfare check."

**Action:** Slowly scroll down the landing page to show:
1. The three feature cards (Daily Check-Ins, Dispatch Dashboard, Emergency Info)
2. The "How It Works" section showing the 4-step flow
3. The statistics section

**Voiceover (while scrolling):**
> "The key innovation: when a constable arrives at a senior's door, they have the emergency response information they need - mobility status, medical equipment, oxygen dependency, cognitive impairment, access codes, pets in the home, neighbor contacts. This information saves lives and prevents injuries during welfare checks."

---

### SCENE 3: Senior Check-In Flow (1:00 - 1:40)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/dashboard` (Senior Community Dashboard - logged in as demo patient)

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's what the senior sees. This is Eleanor Thompson's dashboard - she's 79, has congestive heart failure, and checks in daily. The interface is designed for seniors: large buttons, high contrast, simple navigation."

**Action:** Show the dashboard with:
1. The daily check-in prompt
2. DASH meal of the day
3. Tech tip of the day
4. Recent activity

**Then navigate to:** `/check-in`

**Voiceover:**
> "The daily check-in asks simple wellness questions. Claude generates personalized questions based on the patient's conditions. For Eleanor, it monitors cardiac symptoms, medication adherence, and mood."

**Action:** Show the check-in form. Click through a couple of questions to demonstrate the flow.

---

### SCENE 4: Medicine Cabinet - AI Medication Management (1:40 - 2:30)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/medicine-cabinet`

**Voiceover:**
> "Now let's look at the Medicine Cabinet. This is AI-powered medication management. Eleanor has five active medications. The system tracks adherence rates, upcoming doses, and refill dates - all at a glance."

**Action:** Show the header stat cards:
1. Active Medications count
2. Adherence Rate percentage
3. Medications needing refill
4. Upcoming doses in next 24 hours

**Voiceover:**
> "Each medication card shows dosage, instructions, and an AI confidence score. But here's where Claude really shines - "

**Action:** Click the "Scan Label" tab or button.

**Voiceover:**
> "Seniors or caregivers can photograph a medication label, and Claude Vision reads the entire label automatically - medication name, dosage, instructions, refill information. No typing required. There's also a pill identifier: take a photo of a physical pill, and the AI identifies what it is."

**Action:** Show the Scan Label and Identify Pill tabs briefly.

**Voiceover:**
> "And the system detects drug interactions in real time. If multiple psychiatric medications are prescribed, it flags a safety alert with the specific interaction risk. This is Claude doing clinical pharmacology, not just text processing."

**Action:** If the psychiatric medication alert banner is visible, point to it. Then scroll to show the Adherence tab with the bar charts.

---

### SCENE 5: Vital Signs Capture (2:30 - 3:10)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/vital-capture`

**Voiceover:**
> "Vital signs capture supports four input methods - designed for seniors who may struggle with small keyboards."

**Action:** Show the four capture method tiles (Keyboard, Camera, Photo, Bluetooth).

**Voiceover:**
> "Manual entry with large buttons. Live camera scan that reads the display on a blood pressure monitor or glucometer in real time using Claude Vision. Photo capture for seniors who want to snap a picture and let AI extract the numbers. And Bluetooth device pairing for automatic readings from connected health devices."

**Action:** Click "Manual Entry" and quickly enter a blood pressure reading (e.g., 145/92, pulse 78). Show the critical value warning that appears for the elevated reading.

**Voiceover:**
> "When a reading is outside the safe range, the system immediately flags it. This connects back to the AI risk prediction engine - a pattern of elevated blood pressure readings feeds into the 30-day readmission risk score."

---

### SCENE 6: Memory Lane - Cognitive Health (3:10 - 3:50)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/memory-lane-trivia`

**Voiceover:**

**Action:** Show the trivia interface:
1. The era badge (e.g., "1960s")
2. The difficulty level
3. The cognitive function being trained (e.g., "Training: Memory Recall")
4. Click an answer to show the feedback

**Voiceover:**
> "Each question targets a specific brain region and cognitive function. The AI tracks performance over time, building a longitudinal cognitive profile. A senior who starts struggling with questions they used to get right - that's an early signal for the care team. And the trophy gallery keeps them coming back every day."

**Action:** If visible, show the trophy gallery or completion screen briefly.

---

### SCENE 7: Caregiver Portal + Ask Your Nurse (3:50 - 4:30)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/caregiver-access`

**Voiceover:**
> "Family involvement is critical for senior care. The caregiver portal uses PIN-based access - no registration, no passwords. A senior shares a four-digit PIN with their daughter, and she can view health information, medication status, and check-in history from her own phone."

**Action:** Show the access form with:
1. Phone number and PIN fields
2. The security notice about access logging
3. The "How it works" section

**Voiceover:**
> "Every access is logged and visible to the senior. HIPAA compliant, with 30-minute session timeouts. No caregiver sees more than they're authorized to see."

**Then navigate to:** `/ask-nurse`

**Voiceover:**
> "And when a senior has a health question, they don't need to call a doctor's office. They can type or use voice input to ask their nurse directly. Claude analyzes the question for urgency - if someone types 'chest pain' or 'I fell,' it's automatically flagged as high priority for immediate triage."

**Action:** Show the Ask Your Nurse interface:
1. The voice input microphone button
2. The common questions suggestions
3. A sample answered question with nurse response

---

### SCENE 8: My Health Hub - Connected Ecosystem (4:30 - 5:00)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/my-health`

**Voiceover:**
> "Everything connects in the patient's health hub. Connected devices - smartwatch, smart scale, blood pressure monitor, glucometer, pulse oximeter - all streaming data into one unified record."

**Action:** Show the connected devices grid with status dots (green = connected, gray = available). Then show the health records tiles.

**Voiceover:**
> "Vitals, medications, conditions, allergies, immunizations, care plans - all in one place. And the AI runs care gap detection: missed vaccines, overdue screenings, lapsed follow-ups. The system doesn't wait for the patient to remember - it tells them."

**Action:** Point to the vaccine care gaps indicator if visible. Show the "Download My Records" button.

**Voiceover:**
> "And every bit of this data is exportable as a FHIR-compliant health record. Which brings us to the clinical side."

---

### SCENE 9: Patient Avatar - Visual Clinical Intelligence (5:00 - 5:50)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/shift-handoff` (Shift Handoff Dashboard - shows Patient Avatar in patient cards)

**Voiceover:**
> "Now let me show you something that blew our clinical advisor away. This is the Patient Avatar - every patient gets an interactive body diagram that shows their clinical status at a glance."

**Action:** Show the shift handoff dashboard with patient cards. Point to a patient card that has the avatar thumbnail visible - the SVG body illustration with colored markers on it.

**Voiceover:**
> "Those colored dots on the body aren't decoration. Each one is an anatomical marker: red dots for critical devices like central lines and chest tubes, yellow for PICC lines and catheters, blue for surgical sites, purple for monitoring devices like insulin pumps, green for chronic conditions, orange for neurological issues. A nurse walking into a room sees everything in one glance."

**Action:** Click on an avatar thumbnail to expand to the full body view. Show:
1. The front/back toggle
2. Marker dots at specific anatomical positions
3. The status badge ring around the body (code status, fall risk, isolation badges)
4. Click a marker to show the detail popover with insertion dates and care instructions

**Voiceover:**
> "The badges around the body show code status - DNR, DNI, comfort care - plus precautions like fall risk and isolation type. Yellow for contact isolation, green for droplet, blue for airborne. Hospital-standard color coding that nurses already know."

**Action:** Point to the status badges. If visible, show a pending marker with the pulsing animation.

**Voiceover:**
> "And here's the AI integration. When a clinician dictates notes through Compass Riley - our AI medical scribe - Claude automatically detects device insertions and removals from the transcription. 'Placed a central line in the right jugular' creates a pending marker at the correct anatomical position. The nurse confirms or rejects it. We have 120 marker types mapped to anatomical positions, plus 50 ICD-10 patterns that auto-populate from diagnoses. Five skin tones, three gender presentations, front and back views. This is the kind of clinical tool that takes a hospital IT team months to build."

**Action:** Show the skin tone/gender customization if accessible, or show the diversity of the avatar appearance. Then close the expanded view.

---

### SCENE 10: AI Risk Prediction (5:50 - 6:20)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/readmissions` (Readmission Prevention Dashboard)

**Voiceover:**
> "Every patient gets an AI-generated readmission risk score. Claude analyzes check-in patterns, vitals, medication adherence, social determinants, and clinical history to predict 30-day readmission risk."

**Action:** Show the readmission dashboard with:
1. Patient risk list sorted by score
2. Click on a high-risk patient to expand details
3. Show the AI-generated risk explanation in plain language

**Voiceover:**
> "The AI explains its reasoning: 'Elevated risk due to missed medications on 3 of last 7 days, declining mobility scores, and recent ER visit.' We route these predictions through Opus for complex cases, Sonnet for standard analysis, and Haiku for quick triage - optimizing both accuracy and API cost."

---

### SCENE 11: Constable Dispatch Dashboard (6:20 - 6:50)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/constable-dispatch` (Welfare Check Queue)

**Voiceover:**
> "When a senior misses their check-in and family can't be reached, it escalates here - the constable dispatch dashboard. Officers see a prioritized queue sorted by urgency score. Critical cases surface first."

**Action:** Show:
1. The welfare check queue with patient cards
2. Priority badges (CRITICAL, HIGH)
3. Click on a patient to show the detailed welfare check info panel
4. Point out: mobility status, medical equipment, access instructions, emergency contacts

**Voiceover:**
> "John Doe - urgency score 150, critical priority. Wheelchair user, oxygen dependent, cognitive impairment, fourth floor, elevator required, key under mat, one friendly dog, daughter Jane is primary contact. This is the information that turns a welfare check into an informed emergency response."

---

### SCENE 12: Healthcare Interoperability (6:50 - 7:10)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/healthcare-integrations` (Healthcare Integrations Dashboard)

**Voiceover:**
> "Everything we capture is interoperable. FHIR R4 for modern health systems. HL7 v2.x for legacy systems. X12 837P for claims and billing. Eight MCP servers handling real-time data exchange with CMS coverage databases, NPI registries, and clearinghouses."

**Action:** Show the integrations dashboard. Demonstrate:
1. FHIR patient bundle export
2. HL7 message parsing
3. X12 claim generation

**Voiceover:**
> "We generate real FHIR bundles, parse real HL7 messages, produce real X12 claims. Any hospital can plug into this system and start exchanging data on day one."

---

### SCENE 13: Platform Scale (7:10 - 7:30)

**Screen:** Navigate to `/demo` (Demo Showcase page)

**Voiceover:**
> "What you've seen is still a fraction of the platform. AI medical scribe. Nurse command center. ER dashboard. NeuroSuite for stroke and dementia. Bed management. Care coordination. Billing optimization. All from a single, white-label, multi-tenant codebase. 7,431 tests. 520 database migrations. 141 edge functions. Zero technical debt."

**Action:** Quick scroll through the demo feature cards showing the full breadth of the platform.

---

### SCENE 14: Closing - The Ask (7:30 - 7:50)

**Screen:** Return to `/law-enforcement` (SHIELD Program landing page)

**Voiceover:**
> "We built this with Claude. Not as a chatbot bolted onto a product - as the intelligence layer across 40 specialized clinical services. Risk prediction, documentation, drug safety, care plans, patient avatars, cognitive health, vital sign recognition - all Claude."

> "Two people. A nurse and an AI director. No engineering team. Production-grade healthcare SaaS that meets hospital pilot standards. That's the power of Claude, and that's why we're applying to the Anthology Fund."

> "We're Envision VirtualEdge Group - Maria LeBlanc and Akima Taylor. Thank you for watching."

**Action:** Hold on the SHIELD Program landing page for 3 seconds, then fade to black.

## Talking Points If Asked Follow-Up Questions

**"How does the AI actually work?"**
> 40+ registered AI skills in a database, each with model routing (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus), cost tracking, and accuracy monitoring. Not a generic chatbot - domain-specific clinical intelligence. Claude Vision reads medication labels and vital sign monitors. Claude does risk prediction, drug interaction detection, cognitive assessment analysis, and clinical documentation.

**"What's your competitive advantage?"**
> AI-first architecture. Competitors bolt AI onto existing systems. We built the system FOR AI operation. Plus: two-person team proves Claude enables domain experts to build enterprise software. And we cover the full spectrum - community wellness, clinical care, and law enforcement coordination in one platform.

**"How do you make money?"**
> Multi-tenant SaaS: per-bed/per-patient/month for hospitals, per-member/month for community orgs, per-seat for law enforcement agencies. White-label means each customer gets their own branded instance.

**"What do you need the funding for?"**
> First pilot deployments (SHIELD Program + rural hospital), API costs at scale (Claude usage), and one enterprise sales hire to close hospital contracts.

**"Is this HIPAA compliant?"**
> Yes. PHI audit logging, row-level security on 2,000+ policies, no PHI in browser, encrypted at rest and in transit, SOC 2 aligned controls. PIN-based caregiver access with 30-minute session timeouts and full access audit trails.

**"How is this different from Epic/Cerner?"**
> We're not replacing EHRs - we're the AI intelligence layer that sits alongside them. FHIR R4 interoperability means we connect to Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH on day one. But we also serve the populations they don't: community seniors, home health, law enforcement coordination, and rural facilities that can't afford enterprise EHR add-ons.

**"What about the wellness features - are those just engagement or clinically meaningful?"**
> Both. Memory Lane trivia tracks cognitive function over time - a decline in performance is an early dementia signal. Medication adherence tracking feeds into readmission risk. Vital sign trends trigger clinical alerts. Check-in patterns detect social isolation. Everything the senior does generates clinical intelligence that the care team can act on.
