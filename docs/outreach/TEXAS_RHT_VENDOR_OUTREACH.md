Dear Deputy Executive Commissioner,

I am writing to introduce Envision VirtualEdge Group as a potential technology vendor for Texas's Rural Health Transformation program, specifically the **Lone Star Advanced AI and Telehealth** initiative.

### Who We Are

We have developed two complementary healthcare platforms designed specifically for rural and underserved communities:

- Daily wellness check-ins with AI-powered health monitoring
- Voice-enabled interfaces for seniors with limited tech literacy
- Caregiver coordination and family communication tools
- Community health program integration

**Envision Atlus** — A clinical care management engine providing:
- 40+ AI-powered clinical decision support services
- FHIR-compliant healthcare interoperability
- Real-time care coordination across distributed rural networks
- Prior authorization automation via clearinghouse integration (Waystar, Change Healthcare, Availity)
- Medical coding assistance (ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS)

### Why We Fit the Lone Star Initiative

Our platforms directly address the RHT program's technology priorities:
