# Envision Atlas Admin Panel Branding Fix

## What I Found

### Current Header Colors
- Uses gradient: teal → lime green → teal
- Has "WellFit Community" branding
- Background: `linear-gradient(to right, #158A84, #C8E63D, #158A84)`

### Current Header Buttons (TOO MANY!)
1. Senior View 👤
2. Enroll Senior ➕ (DUPLICATE - also in quick actions)
3. Risk Assessment 📋
4. API Keys 🔑
5. Billing 💳
6. Bulk Export 📤 (DUPLICATE - also in quick actions)
7. Reports 📊 (DUPLICATE - already scrolls to section)
8. System Status ●

### Quick Action Buttons (lower on page)
1. Enroll Senior ➕
2. Bulk Enroll 👥
3. Bulk Export 📤
4. Approve Photos 📸
5. Questions 💬
6. Edit Profiles ✏️

## What I'll Fix

### 1. Header Color - Change to Deep Teal
- Remove gradient
- Use solid deep teal: `#006D75`
- Clean, professional look
- Remove lime green from header

### 2. Remove Duplicate Buttons from Header
**REMOVE:**
- ❌ Enroll Senior (already in quick actions)
- ❌ Bulk Export (already in quick actions)
- ❌ Reports (just scrolls, not needed)

**KEEP:**
- ✅ Risk Assessment (important workflow)
- ✅ Billing (separate from quick actions)
- ✅ API Keys (super admin needs this)
- ✅ Senior View (super admin navigation)
- ✅ System Status (monitoring)

### 3. Title Change
- Change "Admin Panel" to "Envision Atlas"
- Change "WellFit Community" subtitle to "Envision Atlas"

## Result
- Clean deep teal header
- Less crowded buttons
- No duplicates
- "Envision Atlas" branding
