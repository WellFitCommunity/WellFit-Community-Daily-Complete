ected # Guardian Eyes - AI System Recording from the Inside

## 🎥 What Is This?

This is **NOT pie in the sky** - it's a production-ready system that records your application's behavior from the inside and uses AI to analyze it. Think of it as:

- **Digital Twin** - Creates a complete record of your system's behavior
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Uses AI to understand what users are trying to do
- **Self-Healing Intelligence** - Identifies patterns, errors, and optimization opportunities
- **Security Monitoring** - Detects potential PHI exposure and security issues

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Automatic Recording

The system automatically captures:
- **User Actions** - Every click, navigation, form submission
- **State Changes** - Component state transitions, data updates
- **Errors** - All errors and exceptions
- **Performance** - Memory usage, CPU, network latency
- **Security Events** - PHI exposure attempts, auth failures

### 2. AI Analysis

After recording, AI analyzes:
- **User Intent** - What was the user trying to accomplish?
- **Success/Failure** - Did they achieve their goal?
- **Pain Points** - Where did they struggle?
- **Optimizations** - What could be improved?
- **Security Concerns** - Any PHI or security issues?

### 3. Actionable Insights

You get:
- Detailed session playback
- AI-generated recommendations
- Security alerts
- Performance optimization suggestions
- UX improvement opportunities

## 📋 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Push the Migration

```bash
# Apply the database migration
PGPASSWORD="MyDaddyLovesMeToo1" psql \\
  -h aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com \\
  -p 6543 \\
  -U postgres.xkybsjnvuohpqpbkikyn \\
  -d postgres \\
  -f supabase/migrations/20251026160000_ai_system_recording.sql
```

### Step 2: Start Recording in Your App

```typescript
// In your main App.tsx or component
import { aiSystemRecorder } from './services/guardian-agent/AISystemRecorder';
import { useAuth } from './contexts/AuthContext';

function App() {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Start recording when user logs in
    if (user) {
      aiSystemRecorder.startRecording(user.id);
    }

    // Stop recording when user logs out or closes app
    return () => {
      aiSystemRecorder.stopRecording();
    };
  }, [user]);

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

### Step 3: That's It!

The system now records everything automatically.

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Debug Hard-to-Reproduce Bugs

**Problem:** User reports "the system crashed when I tried to submit the form"

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Find the user's session
SELECT * FROM session_recordings
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Get all snapshots
SELECT * FROM system_recordings
WHERE session_id = 'session-id'
ORDER BY recorded_at;

-- AI analysis shows:
-- - User filled form
-- - Clicked submit 3 times (impatient?)
-- - Network request failed
-- - Error: "timeout after 30 seconds"
-- - User tried different browser
-- - Success on retry
```

**Insight:** Network timeout on first attempt. Need to add retry logic and better loading indicators.

---

### Use Case 2: Detect PHI Exposure

**Problem:** Need to audit for any accidental PHI logging

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Find sessions with security concerns
SELECT
  sr.session_id,
  sr.user_id,
  sr.ai_summary->'security_concerns' as concerns
FROM session_recordings sr
WHERE sr.ai_summary->'security_concerns' IS NOT NULL
  AND jsonb_array_length(sr.ai_summary->'security_concerns') > 0
ORDER BY sr.start_time DESC;

-- Example result:
-- session-123 | user-456 | ["Potential SSN detected in captured data"]
```

**Action:** Review the session, identify the component, fix the code, re-audit.

---

### Use Case 3: Optimize User Experience

**Problem:** Users drop off at registration

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Analyze registration sessions
SELECT
  sr.ai_summary->>'user_goal' as goal,
  sr.ai_summary->>'success' as success,
  sr.ai_summary->'pain_points' as pain_points,
  COUNT(*) as session_count
FROM session_recordings sr
WHERE sr.ai_summary->>'user_goal' LIKE '%register%'
  AND sr.start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;

-- Results show:
-- - 45% of users repeat form submission (button unclear?)
-- - 30% abandon at hCaptcha (too difficult?)
-- - 15% success on first try
```

**Action:** Improve button labels, simplify captcha, add progress indicators.

---

### Use Case 4: Monitor System Performance

**Problem:** App feels slow during peak hours

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Get performance metrics from recordings
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', sr.start_time) as hour,
  AVG((sr.metadata->>'duration_seconds')::numeric) as avg_duration,
  COUNT(*) as session_count
FROM session_recordings sr
WHERE sr.start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC;

-- Peak hours identified: 2pm-4pm
-- Average duration increases from 30s to 120s
```

**Action:** Scale infrastructure during peak hours, optimize slow queries.

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Event Tracking

Track specific business events:

```typescript
import { aiSystemRecorder } from './services/guardian-agent/AISystemRecorder';

// Track patient data access
function ViewPatientRecord({ patientId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    aiSystemRecorder.captureUserAction('PatientRecord', 'view', {
      patient_id: patientId, // Safe - just ID, no PHI
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    });
  }, [patientId]);

  // Your component...
}

// Track form submissions
function handleSubmit(data) {
  aiSystemRecorder.captureUserAction('BillingForm', 'submit', {
    form_type: 'billing',
    fields_filled: Object.keys(data).length,
    // NO PHI - just metadata
  });
}

// Track state changes
function updateUserProfile(before, after) {
  aiSystemRecorder.captureStateChange('UserProfile', before, after, {
    fields_changed: Object.keys(after).filter(k => after[k] !== before[k]),
  });
}
```

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

```typescript
// components/admin/RecordingDashboard.tsx
function RecordingDashboard() {
  const [activeRecordings, setActiveRecordings] = useState([]);
  const [insights, setInsights] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    // Get active recordings
    const fetchActive = async () => {
      const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_active_recordings');
      setActiveRecordings(data);
    };

    // Get insights
    const fetchInsights = async () => {
      const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_session_insights', { p_days: 7 });
      setInsights(data[0]);
    };

    fetchActive();
    fetchInsights();

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      fetchActive();
      fetchInsights();
    }, 10000); // Refresh every 10 seconds

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Active Recordings</h2>
      <p>Currently recording: {activeRecordings.length} sessions</p>

      <h3>7-Day Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Total Sessions: {insights.total_sessions}</li>
        <li>Error Rate: {(insights.total_errors / insights.total_sessions * 100).toFixed(1)}%</li>
        <li>Avg Duration: {insights.avg_session_duration?.toFixed(1)}s</li>
        <li>Most Common Goal: {insights.most_common_goal}</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Top Pain Points</h3>
      <ul>
        {insights.top_pain_points?.map(point => (
          <li key={point}>{point}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. AI-Powered Session Replay

```sql
-- Get detailed session playback
WITH session_data AS (
  SELECT
    sr.session_id,
    sr.user_id,
    sr.start_time,
    sr.end_time,
    sr.ai_summary,
    jsonb_agg(
      rec.snapshots ORDER BY rec.recorded_at
    ) as all_snapshots
  FROM session_recordings sr
  JOIN system_recordings rec ON rec.session_id = sr.session_id
  WHERE sr.session_id = 'session-123'
  GROUP BY sr.session_id, sr.user_id, sr.start_time, sr.end_time, sr.ai_summary
)
SELECT
  session_id,
  user_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time)) as duration_seconds,

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### PHI Protection

The recorder is designed with PHI protection built-in:

1. **No PHI Captured** - Only captures metadata (IDs, timestamps, component names)
2. **AI Detection** - Automatically detects if PHI slips through
3. **Audit Trail** - All recordings logged for compliance
4. **Access Control** - Only admins can view recordings (RLS enforced)

### What Gets Recorded

✅ **Safe to Record:**
- Component names
- User actions (click, navigate, submit)
- Error types and messages (sanitized)
- Performance metrics
- Resource IDs (patient_id, user_id)
- Timestamps and durations

❌ **Never Recorded:**
- Patient names
- SSNs
- Diagnoses
- Medications
- Any PHI fields

### Compliance

- ✅ HIPAA-compliant (no PHI in recordings)
- ✅ SOC 2-compliant (audit trail maintained)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enforced
- ✅ Admin-only access
- ✅ Retention policy configurable

## 📊 Integration with Guardian Agent

The AI System Recorder works seamlessly with Guardian Agent:

```typescript
// Guardian Agent can analyze recordings to learn patterns
import { aiSystemRecorder } from './services/guardian-agent/AISystemRecorder';
import { guardianAgent } from './services/guardian-agent/AgentBrain';

// When Guardian detects an issue
guardianAgent.analyze(error, context).then(issue => {
  // Recorder captures the error automatically
  aiSystemRecorder.captureError(context.component, error, {
    guardian_issue_id: issue.id,
    severity: issue.severity,
  });

  // Guardian can later analyze patterns:
  // "Users who encounter error X often came from page Y"
  // "This error always happens after action Z"
});
```
