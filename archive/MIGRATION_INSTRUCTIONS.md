# Database Migration Instructions

## 🚀 Ready to Enable AI-Powered Nurse Questions!

I created a properly formatted Supabase migration that enhances your existing `user_questions` table without breaking anything.

## ✅ What the Migration Does:

### **Safely Enhances Your Existing `user_questions` Table:**
- ✅ **Preserves all existing data** - zero data loss
- ✅ **Adds medical fields** for AI assistance
- ✅ **Backwards compatible** - existing functionality unchanged
- ✅ **Includes rollback** - can be undone if needed

### **New Fields Added:**
- `urgency` - low/medium/high priority
- `ai_suggestions` - AI response suggestions for nurses
- `nurse_notes` - Internal notes not shown to patients
- `patient_context` - Safe patient info for AI
- `updated_at` - Track when responses are added

### **New Features:**
- Question templates for common medical questions
- Patient context function (secure, no sensitive data)
- Nurse dashboard view
- Enhanced categories (adds 'medication', 'emergency')

## 🔧 How to Run the Migration:

### **Option 1: Supabase CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# From your project root
npx supabase db push
```

### **Option 2: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `/supabase/migrations/20250924000001_enhance_user_questions_for_medical.sql`
4. Paste and run the migration

### **Option 3: Command Line**
```bash
# If you have supabase CLI configured
supabase migration up
```

## 🧪 Test the Migration:

### **1. Verify Tables:**
```sql
-- Check the enhanced user_questions table
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'user_questions'
AND table_schema = 'public';

-- Check question templates
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM question_templates;
```

### **2. Test the Components:**
- **Seniors:** Go to "Ask Nurse" tab - should work with your existing table
- **Nurses:** Go to admin "Nurse Questions" - should show enhanced interface

## 🔄 Rollback (if needed):

The migration includes a rollback. If you need to undo:

```sql
-- This removes all enhancements and restores original structure
-- Run the migrate:down section from the migration file
```

## 📋 What Happens After Migration:

### **✅ Immediate Benefits:**
- Enhanced questions page with voice input works
- AI-powered nurse response system works
- Question templates pre-loaded
- Proper table separation (medical vs technical)

### **📊 Your Data:**
- **Existing questions preserved** - all current data intact
- **New questions** get enhanced fields automatically
- **Backwards compatible** - old code still works

## 🎯 Next Steps After Migration:

1. **Test the "Ask Nurse" tab** - should work immediately
2. **Test admin "Nurse Questions"** - AI suggestions ready
3. **Train your nurses** on the new AI-assisted interface
4. **Monitor question categories** - should auto-categorize

## ⚠️ Migration Safety:

- **✅ Safe to run in production** - non-destructive
- **✅ Preserves existing data** - zero downtime
- **✅ Rollback available** - can be undone
- **✅ No breaking changes** - existing code unaffected

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong:

1. **Check Supabase logs** in dashboard
2. **Run rollback** using migrate:down section
3. **Contact me** with the error message

The migration is designed to be extremely safe - it only adds new optional fields and doesn't modify existing functionality.
