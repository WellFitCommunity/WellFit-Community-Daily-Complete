## 📝 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (250 words)

A computer-implemented contextual telehealth system that automatically pre-populates provider interfaces with comprehensive patient context by integrating clinical data from electronic health record (EHR) systems and behavioral engagement data from community health platforms prior to and during video consultation encounters. Upon initiation of a telehealth appointment, the system automatically retrieves and aggregates patient information from multiple data sources including EHR clinical records (demographics, active medications, recent lab results, vital signs, diagnoses, allergies, care plans), community platform engagement data (daily check-in patterns, medication adherence self-reports, social interaction metrics, family support indicators, patient-reported symptoms, wellness activity tracking), and presents said data in a unified provider interface accessible during the video consultation.

The system employs an artificial intelligence summarization engine that analyzes the aggregated clinical and behavioral data to generate concise visit preparation summaries highlighting key information relevant to the appointment reason, recent changes in patient status, concerning patterns requiring discussion, and recommended discussion topics based on patient's current health trajectory. The provider interface features a split-screen display showing live video consultation alongside real-time access to patient's complete health profile, enabling providers to reference clinical data, engagement metrics, and historical patterns without switching between multiple applications or systems.

Post-consultation, the system automatically synchronizes visit documentation back to the hospital EHR system, creates community platform action items based on the care plan discussed, establishes medication reminders for new prescriptions, schedules follow-up appointments, and notifies authorized family members of visit outcomes. This invention significantly improves telehealth encounter quality by providing providers with complete patient context that is typically fragmented across multiple systems, reduces visit preparation time from 10-15 minutes to under 1 minute, improves clinical decision-making through comprehensive data visibility, enhances patient experience through more informed and personalized consultations, and eliminates workflow inefficiencies caused by system fragmentation in traditional telehealth platforms.

## 🎯 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

This invention relates to telehealth and telemedicine systems, specifically to systems and methods for automatically pre-populating provider interfaces with comprehensive patient clinical and behavioral data during video consultation encounters, integrating data from electronic health records and patient engagement platforms into unified provider workflows.

### Description of Related Art and Problems Solved

**Problem #1: Fragmented Provider Workflows in Traditional Telehealth**

Current telehealth platforms operate in isolation from clinical data systems:

**Typical Provider Workflow:**
1. Provider clicks "Start Telehealth Appointment" in video platform
2. Video call window opens showing patient
3. Provider must SEPARATELY log into hospital EHR system
4. Provider must MANUALLY search for patient by name
5. Provider must MANUALLY navigate to relevant sections (meds, labs, etc.)
6. Provider switches back and forth between video window and EHR
7. Two separate applications on two separate screens (or constant window switching)

**Consequences:**
- **Wasted time:** 5-15 minutes per visit spent finding and reviewing patient information
- **Poor user experience:** Constant context switching disrupts conversation flow
- **Incomplete information:** Providers may miss important data due to time pressure
- **Reduced eye contact:** Provider looking at separate screen instead of patient video
- **Documentation burden:** Must separately document in EHR after visit
- **Patient frustration:** Patients wait while provider searches for information

**Problem #2: Missing Behavioral Context in Telehealth Encounters**

Traditional telehealth sessions provide providers with access to clinical EHR data (if integrated at all) but lack visibility into patient's behavioral health and engagement patterns:

**What Providers CAN'T See:**
- Whether patient is taking medications as prescribed (between clinical visits)
- Patient's daily symptom patterns and trends
- Social isolation and family support status
- Patient's health literacy and self-care engagement
- Mood trends and mental health indicators from patient-generated content
- Real-world adherence to care plan recommendations

**Consequences:**
- **Incomplete clinical picture:** Decisions made without behavioral context
- **Missed opportunities:** Provider doesn't know patient is struggling with adherence
- **Reactive care:** Problems discussed after they've persisted for weeks
- **Patient feels unheard:** "I've been trying to tell you I can't afford my meds for a month"
- **Care plan failures:** Plans created without understanding patient's real-world barriers

**Problem #3: No Intelligent Visit Preparation**

Providers enter telehealth visits "cold" without automated preparation or summarization:

- Must manually review entire chart to understand patient's current status
- No intelligent highlighting of recent changes or concerning trends
- No AI-generated visit summaries focusing on relevant information
- No proactive identification of topics that should be discussed
- Same workflow for routine follow-up vs. urgent concern visits

**Consequences:**
- **Time inefficiency:** 10-15 minutes spent reviewing chart before/during visit
- **Missed red flags:** Provider may not notice concerning lab result from 2 weeks ago
- **Inconsistent quality:** Visit quality depends on provider's thoroughness in manual review
- **Provider burnout:** Cognitive overload from information synthesis burden

**Problem #4: Post-Visit Documentation and Follow-Up Fragmentation**

After telehealth visits, providers must manually complete multiple disconnected workflows:

- Document visit notes in EHR (separate system from video platform)
- Manually send prescriptions to pharmacy
- Manually schedule follow-up appointments
- Manually send instructions to patient (separate messaging system)
- No automatic conversion of care plan to patient action items
- No automatic family notification of visit outcomes

**Consequences:**
- **30-45 minutes** of post-visit documentation time per encounter
- **Delays:** Prescriptions and orders not sent until hours after visit
- **Patient confusion:** No clear action items or next steps
- **Missed follow-ups:** Follow-up appointments not scheduled due to workflow friction
- **Family uninformed:** Authorized caregivers not updated on visit outcomes

**Problem #5: Poor ROI on Telehealth Technology Investments**

Healthcare organizations have invested heavily in:
- Telehealth video platforms ($100k-$500k/year)
- EHR systems ($1M-$50M implementations)
- Patient engagement platforms ($50k-$500k/year)

But these systems operate in silos, providing minimal workflow integration and forcing providers to manually stitch together information across platforms.

**Consequences:**
- **Low provider adoption:** Telehealth seen as "extra work" rather than efficiency gain
- **Poor patient outcomes:** Fragmented care delivery
- **Unrealized value:** Technology investments don't deliver promised efficiency
- **Competitive disadvantage:** Healthcare organizations can't compete on convenience

### Objects and Advantages of the Invention

The present invention overcomes these limitations by providing:

1. **Unified Provider Interface:** Single screen showing video + complete patient context
2. **Automatic Pre-Population:** All relevant patient data loaded before call starts
3. **Comprehensive Context:** Both clinical (EHR) and behavioral (engagement) data visible
4. **AI-Powered Preparation:** Intelligent summarization highlighting key information
5. **Real-Time Access:** Provider can reference any patient data during conversation
6. **Automated Documentation:** Visit notes automatically sync to EHR post-visit
7. **Integrated Follow-Up:** Care plan items automatically become patient action items
8. **Time Savings:** Reduces pre-visit prep and post-visit documentation by 70-80%
9. **Better Decisions:** Comprehensive data visibility improves clinical decision-making
10. **Higher Quality:** Consistent, thorough patient context for every encounter

### Component 1: Automatic Patient Context Assembly Engine

**Purpose:** Automatically retrieve and aggregate all relevant patient data from multiple sources when telehealth appointment is initiated, presenting comprehensive context to provider before/during video consultation.

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for patent filing purposes

class PatientContextAssemblyEngine {

  // Main orchestration: Assemble complete patient context
  async assemblePatientContext(appointmentId: string) {
    const appointment = await this.getAppointment(appointmentId);
    const patientId = appointment.patientId;
    const appointmentReason = appointment.reason;

    // PARALLEL DATA RETRIEVAL - All sources fetched simultaneously
    const [clinicalData, engagementData, historicalData] = await Promise.all([
      this.retrieveClinicalData(patientId),
      this.retrieveEngagementData(patientId),
      this.retrieveHistoricalContext(patientId, appointment)
    ]);

    // INTELLIGENT FILTERING - Only relevant data for this visit
    const relevantContext = await this.filterRelevantData({
      clinical: clinicalData,
      engagement: engagementData,
      historical: historicalData,
      appointmentReason: appointmentReason,
      providerSpecialty: appointment.provider.specialty
    });

    // AI SUMMARIZATION - Generate concise visit preparation summary
    const aiSummary = await this.generateAISummary(relevantContext, appointmentReason);

    // ASSEMBLE UNIFIED CONTEXT
    return {
      appointmentId: appointmentId,
