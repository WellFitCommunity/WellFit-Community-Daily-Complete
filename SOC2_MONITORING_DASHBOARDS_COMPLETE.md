- [ ] Configure alerting (optional - via Supabase webhooks)
- [ ] Document for SOC 2 auditor

---

## Customization Guide

### Adjusting Auto-Refresh Intervals

In each dashboard component, find this code:
```typescript
// Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
const interval = setInterval(loadSecurityData, 30000);
```

Change `30000` to your preferred milliseconds:
- 15 seconds: `15000`
- 1 minute: `60000`
- 5 minutes: `300000`

### Modifying SLA Thresholds

Edit the view in the migration file:
```sql
-- Current SLA: 1 hour for CRITICAL
WHEN se.severity = 'CRITICAL' AND (NOW() - se.timestamp) > INTERVAL '1 hour'

-- Change to 30 minutes:
WHEN se.severity = 'CRITICAL' AND (NOW() - se.timestamp) > INTERVAL '30 minutes'
```

Then redeploy: `npx supabase db push`

### Adding Custom Security Events

Use the service method:
```typescript
import { createSOC2MonitoringService } from '../../services/soc2MonitoringService';

const service = createSOC2MonitoringService(supabase);
await service.createSecurityEvent(
  'CUSTOM_EVENT_TYPE',
  'HIGH',
  'Description of what happened',
  { customField: 'value' }
);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Shows No Data

**Problem:** Dashboards load but show "No events recorded"

**Solution:**
1. Verify migration deployed: `SELECT * FROM compliance_status;`
2. Check if security events exist: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM security_events;`
3. If no events, system is working - just no security events yet
4. Generate test event using the service method above

### View Not Found Error

**Problem:** Database error "relation does not exist"

**Solution:**
```bash
npx supabase db push
```
This will create all missing views.

### Slow Dashboard Loading

**Problem:** Dashboards take >5 seconds to load

**Solution:**
1. Check if database has indexes:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'security_events';
   ```
2. Indexes should exist from your SOC 2 migrations
3. If missing, re-run migration: `npx supabase db push`

### Compliance Score Shows 0%

**Problem:** Executive dashboard shows 0% compliance

**Solution:**
1. Verify encryption keys exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM encryption_keys WHERE is_active = TRUE;
   ```
2. If empty, run your SOC 2 security foundation migration
3. Compliance score recalculates automatically

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ All dashboards require admin role
- ‚úÖ Uses your existing `RequireAdminAuth` wrapper
- ‚úÖ Database views have RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Only authenticated users can query

### Data Privacy
- ‚úÖ IP addresses are logged (required for security)
- ‚úÖ PHI is referenced by ID, not displayed in logs
- ‚úÖ User emails shown only to admins
- ‚úÖ Audit logs are tamper-proof (checksums)

### Audit Trail Integrity
- ‚úÖ 7-year retention in `audit_logs` table
- ‚úÖ Checksum validation for each log entry
- ‚úÖ Immutable (no delete/update permissions)
- ‚úÖ Meets HIPAA and SOC 2 requirements

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Easy Additions You Could Make

1. **Email Alerts:**
   - Use Supabase Edge Functions
   - Trigger on CRITICAL security events
   - Send to security@your-domain.com

2. **Slack Integration:**
   - Webhook on SLA breaches
   - Post to #security-alerts channel

3. **PDF Report Export:**
   - Add export button to Executive Summary
   - Generate PDF for board meetings

4. **Trend Charts:**
   - Add Recharts library
   - Visualize security events over time
   - Show compliance score history

5. **Geolocation Mapping:**
   - Plot login attempts on world map
   - Detect impossible travel scenarios

**All of these are easy to add when you need them - infrastructure is ready.**

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Simulate Security Events
```typescript
// In browser console on admin panel
const service = createSOC2MonitoringService(supabase);

// Create test critical event
await service.createSecurityEvent(
  'TEST_CRITICAL',
  'CRITICAL',
  'This is a test critical security event',
  { test: true }
);

// Create test PHI access
await supabase.rpc('log_audit_event', {
  p_event_type: 'PHI_READ',
  p_event_category: 'PHI_ACCESS',
  p_resource_type: 'patient',
  p_resource_id: 'test-patient-123',
  p_operation: 'READ',
  p_metadata: { test: true },
  p_success: true
});
```

Wait 30 seconds and verify events appear in dashboards.

---

## Documentation for Auditors

When a SOC 2 auditor asks for evidence of security monitoring:

1. **Show them the Executive Summary dashboard**
   - Demonstrates real-time compliance tracking
   - Shows automated control testing

2. **Export audit logs:**
   ```sql
   COPY (SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days')
   TO '/tmp/audit_logs_q4_2025.csv' CSV HEADER;
   ```

3. **Show retention policy:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM data_retention_policies WHERE table_name = 'audit_logs';
   ```

4. **Demonstrate incident response:**
   - Show Incident Response Center
   - Walk through investigation workflow
   - Show SLA tracking

**This meets SOC 2 Type II requirements for continuous monitoring.**

---
