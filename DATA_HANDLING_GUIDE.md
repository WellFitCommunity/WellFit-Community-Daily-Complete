## üéØ The Good News First

**You're already doing most things right!** Your app has:
- ‚úÖ User consent tracking (`consent` field in profiles)
- ‚úÖ Field-level encryption for sensitive health data
- ‚úÖ Proper access controls and audit logging
- ‚úÖ A privacy policy that clearly explains data collection

## üõ†Ô∏è What You Need to Add (Simple Solutions)

### 1. Data Retention Policy (30 minutes to implement)

**The Rule:** Keep data only as long as needed, then automatically delete it.

**Simple Implementation:**
- Health check-ins: Keep for 7 years (medical records standard)
- User accounts: Delete 3 years after last login
- Audit logs: Keep for 7 years (compliance requirement)

### 2. User Data Rights (1 hour to implement)

**What Users Can Request:**
- See their data (already possible through dashboard)
- Delete their account and data
- Download their data
- Correct incorrect information

### 3. Automated Cleanup (2 hours to implement)

**Set up simple automated jobs to:**
- Archive old check-ins after 7 years
- Delete inactive user accounts after warnings
- Clean up temporary files and logs
