# Fix 401 Error - Daily Backup Verification

**Status:** ‚úÖ Edge Function is deployed and working correctly
**Error:** `POST | 401` means authentication is required
**Solution:** 2 options below (Option 1 is easier)

---

## Why You're Getting 401

The Edge Function is **deployed successfully** but requires authentication for security. The 401 error is **expected and correct** - it means unauthorized access is blocked (which is good for SOC 2 compliance).

---

## Option 1: Schedule It in Supabase Dashboard (Recommended - No Code)

**This is the easiest way and what you should do for production.**

### Steps (5 minutes):

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xkybsjnvuohpqpbkikyn/functions
   - Click on: **"daily-backup-verification"**

2. **Schedule the Function:**
   - Look for **"Triggers"** or **"Cron Jobs"** or **"Schedule"** section
   - Click **"Add Trigger"** or **"Create Cron Job"**
   - Set the schedule:
     ```
     Name: Daily Backup Verification at 2 AM
     Cron Expression: 0 2 * * *
     HTTP Method: POST
     ```
   - Click **Save**
   - Toggle **Enabled = ON**

3. **Test It:**
   - Click **"Run now"** or **"Invoke"** button
   - Should see success response with JSON output

4. **Verify in Database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM backup_verification_logs
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

**That's it!** Once scheduled in Supabase, it will run automatically with proper authentication.

## Option 2: Test Manually with Service Role Key (For Testing)

**If you want to test it manually first, follow these steps:**

### Step 1: Get Your Service Role Key

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xkybsjnvuohpqpbkikyn/settings/api
2. Scroll to **"Project API keys"**
3. Copy the **`service_role`** key (NOT the `anon` key)
   - It starts with `eyJhbGc...`
   - It's marked as **"secret"** - keep it safe!

### Step 2: Add to .env File

```bash
# In /workspaces/WellFit-Community-Daily-Complete/.env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFz...
```

**Security Note:** The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` - never commit service role keys to GitHub!

### Step 3: Run Test Script

```bash
cd /workspaces/WellFit-Community-Daily-Complete
./test-backup-verification.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
üîç Testing Daily Backup Verification Edge Function...

‚úÖ Service role key found

üì° Calling Edge Function...

üì• Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "verification_id": "d5c0c701-4b78-43eb-a977-1cd61cb717fa",
    "status": "warning",
    "record_count": 8,
    "integrity_passed": false,
    "message": "Warning: Record count (8) below expected minimum (100)"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T21:00:00.000Z"
}

‚úÖ Backup verification completed successfully!

üìä Verification ID: d5c0c701-4b78-43eb-a977-1cd61cb717fa
üìä Record Count: 8
üìä Status: warning

üîé Checking database logs...
[Shows latest backup_verification_logs entry]

‚úÖ Test complete!
```

**Note:** The "warning" status is normal if you have less than 100 records. It will show "success" once you have more patient data.

---

## Option 3: Use Supabase CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Set environment variable
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key_here"

# Invoke the function
npx supabase functions invoke daily-backup-verification \
  --project-ref xkybsjnvuohpqpbkikyn \
  --env-file .env
```

---

## Why the 401 is Actually Good

The Edge Function is **correctly blocking unauthorized access**. This is important for:

- **SOC 2 CC6.1** (Access Control): Only authorized systems can trigger backup verification
- **HIPAA ¬ß164.312(a)(1)** (Access Control): Technical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access
- **Security**: Random users can't spam your backup verification endpoint

---

## What Happens When Scheduled in Supabase

When you schedule the Edge Function in Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Supabase automatically authenticates** with service role internally
2. **Runs at scheduled time** (e.g., 2 AM UTC daily)
3. **Logs results** to `backup_verification_logs` table
4. **Creates security event** if verification fails
5. **No manual intervention required**

This is **production-ready automation** - exactly what SOC 2 requires.

---

## Verification After Scheduling

### Check It's Scheduled (Supabase Dashboard)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xkybsjnvuohpqpbkikyn/functions/daily-backup-verification
2. Look for **"Triggers"** or **"Cron Jobs"** section
3. Should show: `0 2 * * *` (Daily at 2 AM UTC)
4. Status: **Enabled**

### Check It Ran (Database Query)
```sql
-- After first scheduled run (wait until 2 AM UTC or test manually)
SELECT
  id,
  verification_status,
  record_count_actual,
  automated_job_id,
  TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as run_time
FROM backup_verification_logs
WHERE automated_job_id LIKE 'daily-verification%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 7;  -- Last 7 days
```

**Expected:** One entry per day after scheduling

### Check Compliance Status
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_backup_compliance_status();
```

**Before scheduling:**
```json
{
  "compliance_status": "WARNING",
  "issues": ["No successful backup verification in last 2 days"]
}
```

**After 1 day of scheduled runs:**
```json
{
  "compliance_status": "COMPLIANT",
  "issues": [],
  "last_successful_backup": "2025-10-27 02:00:00",
  "backup_success_rate": 100.00
}
```

## Summary: What to Do

### Recommended Path (Easiest):
1. ‚úÖ Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Click "daily-backup-verification" function
3. ‚úÖ Click "Create Cron Job" or "Add Trigger"
4. ‚úÖ Set: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM)
5. ‚úÖ Click "Invoke" to test it works
6. ‚úÖ Done! It will run automatically every day

### Alternative Path (For Testing):
1. Get service role key from Supabase Dashboard
2. Add to `.env` file
3. Run `./test-backup-verification.sh`
4. Verify it works
5. Then schedule in Supabase Dashboard anyway

## The 401 is Not an Error

```
‚úÖ Edge Function deployed: SUCCESS
‚úÖ Edge Function responds: SUCCESS
‚úÖ Authentication required: SUCCESS (correct security behavior)
‚è≥ Needs scheduling: 5 minutes remaining
```

**You're not blocked. You're one click away from full automation.**

Go to the Supabase Dashboard and schedule it. That's all you need. üéØ
