## Implementation Details

### AI Risk Assessment Algorithm

The system uses a multi-dimensional risk scoring approach:

```typescript
// Risk factors considered:
- Blood pressure readings (systolic/diastolic)
- Heart rate patterns
- Glucose levels
- Oxygen saturation
- Check-in adherence patterns
- Historical trends
- Emergency indicators
```

### Risk Scoring Matrix

| Risk Level | Score Range | Criteria | Action Required |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| LOW | 0-39 | Normal vitals, good adherence | Monthly review |
| MODERATE | 40-59 | Some abnormal readings | Bi-weekly review |
| HIGH | 60-79 | Multiple concerning factors | Weekly review |
| CRITICAL | 80-100 | Severe abnormalities, emergencies | Immediate intervention |

### FHIR Resource Mapping

#### Patient Resource
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "user-uuid",
  "identifier": [
    {
      "use": "usual",
      "system": "http://wellfit-community.com/patient-ids",
      "value": "WF-12345678"
    }
  ],
  "active": true,
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "LastName",
      "given": ["FirstName"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Observation Resources
- Blood pressure measurements (LOINC: 85354-9)
- Heart rate (LOINC: 8867-4)
- Glucose measurements (LOINC: 33747-0)
- Oxygen saturation (LOINC: 2708-6)
- Mood assessments (LOINC: 72133-2)

## AI Analytics Features

### 1. Population Risk Matrix
Categorizes patients into four quadrants:
- **High Risk, Low Adherence** → Immediate intervention
- **High Risk, High Adherence** → Intensive monitoring
- **Low Risk, Low Adherence** → Engagement programs
- **Low Risk, High Adherence** → Maintenance care

### 2. Predictive Analytics
- **Cardiovascular Events**: 6-month risk prediction
- **Diabetes Complications**: 3-month outlook
- **Hospital Readmission**: 30-day risk assessment
- **Population Trends**: Seasonal and demographic analysis

### 3. Quality Metrics
- **FHIR Compliance**: Bundle validation and standards adherence
- **Data Quality**: Completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness
- **Clinical Quality**: Guideline adherence, outcome metrics

### 4. Automated Interventions

- Automated care recommendation engine
- Resource allocation suggestions
- Preventive care scheduling
