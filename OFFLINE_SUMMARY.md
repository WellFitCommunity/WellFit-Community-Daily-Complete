## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Service Worker:
- [ ] Open app in browser
- [ ] Check console for "✅ WellFit is now available offline!"
- [ ] Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- [ ] Verify "activated and running"

### ✅ Offline Mode:
- [ ] While online: Visit Self-Reporting page
- [ ] DevTools → Network → Set to "Offline"
- [ ] Refresh page - should still load
- [ ] Fill form and submit
- [ ] Should save successfully

### ✅ Pulse Oximeter:
- [ ] Click "Measure Now" button
- [ ] Place finger on camera
- [ ] Wait 15 seconds
- [ ] Values auto-fill
- [ ] Works offline

### ✅ Sync:
- [ ] Create report while offline
- [ ] Go back online
- [ ] Check bottom-left indicator
- [ ] Should auto-sync
- [ ] Or click "Sync Now"

## 📊 Technical Details

### Storage:
```
Browser: IndexedDB + Cache API
Capacity: ~60% of available disk space
Typical Usage: 5-10MB for months of data
Encryption: Browser/OS-level (AES-256)
```

### Sync Logic:
```
1. Check if online
2. If online → Try save to Supabase
3. If offline OR save fails → Save locally
4. When online returns → Auto-sync all pending
5. On success → Delete from local storage
6. On failure → Retry (max 3 attempts)
```

### Security:
```
- HTTPS required (enforced by Service Worker)
- TLS 1.2+ for transmission
- Browser sandboxing
- Same-origin policy
- User authentication required
- Session timeout
```

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Service Worker not registering"
**Solution**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled. Service Workers don't work on HTTP (except localhost).

### "App doesn't work offline"
**Solution**: Visit the app once while online. Must cache files first.

### "Data not syncing"
**Solution**: Click offline indicator → Press "Sync Now". Check console for errors.

### "Storage quota exceeded"
**Solution**: Request persistent storage or clear old data after sync.
