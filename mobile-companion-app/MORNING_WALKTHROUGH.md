# 🌅 Morning Walkthrough: Complete Dementia Care App Setup

## ☕ Before You Start (5 minutes)
1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project
2. **Have your phone ready** for testing (Android or iPhone)
3. **Get a coffee** ☕ - we'll be testing a production-grade medical app!

---

## 📱 Step 1: Initial Setup (10 minutes)

### Navigate to the mobile app directory:
```bash
cd /workspaces/WellFit-Community-Daily-Complete/mobile-companion-app
```

### Check what we have:
```bash
ls -la
```
**You should see:**
- ✅ `src/DementiaCareApp.js` (main app - complete!)
- ✅ `App.js` (entry point)
- ✅ `package.json` (dependencies)
- ✅ `app.config.js` (app configuration)
- ✅ `.env.example` (environment template)
- ✅ All the config files I created

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Environment Setup (5 minutes)

### Create your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Edit the .env file (optional for testing):
```bash
nano .env
```

**For quick testing, you can leave defaults. For production, you'll need:**
- Google Maps API key
- EAS project ID
- Branding customization

---

## 📦 Step 3: Install Dependencies (5-10 minutes)

### Install all required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

**If you see any peer dependency warnings, that's normal for React Native.**

### Verify installation:
```bash
npm list --depth=0
```

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Run Tests (5 minutes)

### Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

**Expected result:**
- ✅ Tests should pass (or show specific issues we can fix)
- ✅ Coverage report will show what's tested

### Run linting:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Format code:
```bash
npm run format
```

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Start the Development Server (2 minutes)

### Start Expo development server:
```bash
npm start
```

**What you'll see:**
- QR code in terminal
- Web interface opens at `http://localhost:8081`
- Metro bundler starts

---

## 📲 Step 6: Test on Your Phone (10 minutes)

### Install Expo Go app on your phone:
- **Android**: [Play Store - Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
- **iPhone**: [App Store - Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

### Connect your phone:
1. **Scan the QR code** from terminal with Expo Go app
2. **Wait for app to load** (first time takes 2-3 minutes)
3. **Grant permissions** when prompted:
   - Location (Always) ← **Critical for geofencing**
   - Camera ← **For health monitoring**
   - Notifications ← **For emergency alerts**

---

## 🏥 Step 7: Test Core Features (15 minutes)

### Test 1: App Launch & HIPAA Consent
- ✅ App should show "Dementia Care Monitor" title
- ✅ HIPAA consent dialog should appear
- ✅ Accept consent to continue

### Test 2: Patient Information
- ✅ Enter a test patient name: "John Doe"
- ✅ Enter caregiver phone: Your actual phone number
- ✅ Add emergency contact

### Test 3: Safe Zone Setup
- ✅ Tap "Set Current Location as Safe Zone"
- ✅ Should show "Safe Zone Set" alert
- ✅ Set radius to 50 meters for testing

### Test 4: Geofence Monitoring
- ✅ Toggle "Geofence Monitoring" ON
- ✅ Status should show "INSIDE SAFE ZONE"
- ✅ Walk outside 50 meters (if possible) to test alerts

### Test 5: Health Monitoring
- ✅ Tap "❤️ Measure Pulse & Oxygen"
- ✅ Camera should open with flashlight
- ✅ Place finger over camera for 30 seconds
- ✅ Should get simulated heart rate and SpO2 readings

### Test 6: Emergency Features
- ✅ Tap "📞 CALL CAREGIVER" (will dial your number)
- ✅ Tap "📍 Share Current Location" (sends SMS with location)

---

## 🔍 Step 8: Verify Data Storage (5 minutes)

### Check encrypted data storage:
1. **Enter some data** (patient name, take health reading)
2. **Close and reopen app**
3. **Verify data persists** ← This confirms encryption is working

### Check system diagnostics:
- ✅ Tap "View Full Diagnostics"
- ✅ Should show location history, health records, system status

---

## 🎯 Step 9: Production Build Test (10 minutes)

### Create a preview build:
```bash
npm run build:android:dev
```
**OR**
```bash
npm run build:ios:dev
```

**This will:**
- Create optimized build
- Show build progress
- Generate APK/IPA for testing

---

## 🚨 If You Encounter Issues

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue: "Metro bundler failed to start"**
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```
