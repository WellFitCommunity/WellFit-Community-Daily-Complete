## üîí Data Security at Rest (Offline Storage)

### Browser-Based Encryption

#### What's Protected:
```
üì± Device Storage (HIPAA PHI)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üíæ IndexedDB
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Health reports (mood, vitals, symptoms)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pulse measurements (heart rate, SpO2)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User identification data
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÑÔ∏è Cache Storage
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Application code (no PHI)
```

#### Browser Security Features:
1. **Origin Isolation**: Data only accessible by WellFit app

**Risk**: Other users accessing PHI
**Mitigation**:
- Clear data on logout option
- Session timeout after inactivity
- Browser profile separation recommended
- Incognito/private mode for shared devices

#### 3. **Browser Vulnerabilities**
**Risk**: XSS or injection attacks
**Mitigation**:

## üîç Audit & Compliance Monitoring

### Logging Captured:

```javascript
// Example log entries (client-side)
[OfflineStorage] Report saved offline: offline_1234567890_abc123
[OfflineStorage] Syncing 3 pending reports...
[OfflineStorage] Synced report offline_1234567890_abc123
[ServiceWorker] App is running in offline mode

// Server-side audit (Supabase)
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "action": "self_report_created",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "source": "offline_sync",
  "ip_address": "redacted",
  "success": true
}
```

### Compliance Reporting:

Monitor these metrics:
