## Known Warnings (Non-Blocking)

### Build Warnings
- Source map warnings from `@daily-co/daily-react` (library issue, not yours)
- 555 ESLint warnings (console.log, unused vars) - **NOT blocking production**

### Recommended Pre-Demo Cleanup (Optional)
1. Replace `console.log` with `logPhiAccess()` in critical paths
2. Fix React hooks exhaustive-deps warnings
3. Remove unused imports

**Impact:** None - these are code quality improvements, not functional issues

A: 2-4 weeks after credentials provided. Architecture is ready today.

**Q: "What's the ROI?"**
A: SMART Scribe alone captures $120/encounter average. With 100 encounters/day, that's $12,000/day = $3.6M annually.
