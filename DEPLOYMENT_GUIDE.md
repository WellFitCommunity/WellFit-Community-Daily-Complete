Your app can work offline using **PWA (Progressive Web App)** technology:

### Add PWA Manifest:

Create `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "WellFit EMS",
  "short_name": "WellFit EMS",
  "description": "EMS Prehospital Handoff System",
  "start_url": "/ems",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#3b82f6",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/logo-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/logo-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add to `index.html`:
```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
```

**Result:** App installs like native app, works offline, syncs when connected
